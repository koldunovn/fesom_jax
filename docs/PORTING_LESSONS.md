# Porting lessons — FESOM2 → JAX

A **living log** of experiences, gotchas, and hard-won facts from porting FESOM2
to JAX. Mirrors the C/Kokkos "lesson log" discipline. **Rule: append to this file
whenever a session/task surfaces something non-obvious** — a config that differs
from the docs, a sign/index/association-order trap, an AD subtlety, a fidelity
surprise, or a "this cost me an hour" fact. One entry = one lesson. Keep entries
short and concrete; link the source file + line. Newest phase at the bottom.

Format per entry: **[area] one-line claim.** Then *why it matters* + *how to apply*.
Cite the C source (`file:line`) or dump probe that proves it.

## Cross-cutting (apply everywhere)

- **[fidelity] Bit-identity to C is impossible; target tolerance classes.** Scatters
  (`segment_sum`) and global reductions reassociate FP sums and JAX does not preserve
  C's edge/element order. Target: **~1e-15** for map/gather kernels, **~1e-12** for
  scatter/reduction kernels. Do *not* chase a scatter discrepancy below ~1e-12 — it is
  reassociation, not a bug (`port_kokkos/docs/SCATTER_STRATEGY.md`). This costs nothing
  for AD (a scatter's gradient is a gather).

- **[verify] Always truncate the JAX probe column to the record's `nlevels` before
  diffing.** The dump drops below-bottom padding; a full-length compare fails on the
  tail. Node → `nlevels_nod2D`; element → `nlevels`. `verify.compare_column` does this.

- **[masks] Layer vs interface validity is a two-class distinction, not one.** Layer
  fields (T,S,ρ,p,u,v,pgf) valid `k ∈ [ulevels-1, nlevels-1)` (exclusive bottom);
  interface fields (bvfreq,w,Kv,Av) valid `k ∈ [ulevels-1, nlevels-1]` (inclusive, one
  deeper). Use `node_/elem_ × layer/iface_mask` from `mesh.py`. Getting this wrong
  shows up as a wrong/zero value at exactly the bottom level in the probe diff
  (`fesom_eos.c:93-208`). Concretely in the substep-1 dump: density/pressure are 0 at
  index `nlevels-1` (masked layer tail) while bvfreq is *nonzero* there (interface
  bottom-pad) — same column, different last-level behaviour.

- **[constants] Use the truncated π = 3.14159265358979, not `jnp.pi`.** `RAD`, `OMEGA`,
  cyclic length all derive from it; full-precision π seeds ~1e-13 into every rotation
  and breaks gates. Already in `config.py`. Verified `config.py` ↔ `fesom_constants.h`
  match for PI, RAD, DENSITY_0=1030, G=9.81, R_EARTH=6367500, OMEGA.

- **[mesh] `nl = 48` globally for pi.** FRESH_START's "nl≈23" is the per-node count.
  Size every node/elem column to `nl=48`. Export is **already 0-based** (no 1→0
  conversion); `edge_tri`/`edge_up_dn_tri` use `−1` for boundary (masked by
  `ops.scatter_add`).

- **[probes] Node probes are 1-based gids; JAX index = gid − 1.** Pinned node gids
  `1001,1500,2000,2500,3000`; element probes = first incident cell `1757,2656,3688,
  4604,5575`. Element records carry the *element* gid, node records the node gid.

- **[golden-rule] Preserve the exact math + load-bearing association order, but express
  it as vectorized `ops.py` array ops.** Not a literal loop-by-loop translation; do not
  simplify the physics. When in doubt, dump the C value at a probe and match it.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations

- **[env] Levante env is mamba `fesom-jax`, jax 0.10.1 x64, A100.** Use
  `/work/ab0995/a270088/mambaforge/envs/fesom-jax/bin/python` for ALL python/pytest
  (NOT base conda). Login-node `cuInit 303` warning is the benign GPU-absent fallback;
  `JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu` silences it. Phase 2 is pure JAX → CPU is fine.

- **[oracle] The per-substep oracle is the *C-port* dump writer (Path A), not the
  Fortran shim.** `fesom2_port/src/fesom_dump.c` (branch `jax-mesh-export`) dumps node
  **and** element fields at the exact JAX config, so JAX↔C diffs are pure FP
  reassociation. The pre-existing Fortran dump uses a realistic stratified IC +
  KPP/opt_visc5 → **not** per-substep comparable; climate-level cross-check only.

## Phase 1 — Mesh & State

- **[pytree] `Mesh`/`State` are frozen dataclasses registered via
  `register_dataclass`.** For `Mesh`, the 31 arrays are leaves and the 7 scalar counts
  are static meta (they fix shapes + `segment_sum` segment counts → must be Python
  ints, not traced). For `State`, every field is a data leaf.

- **[AD] The two AD gates that matter were proven in Phase 1:** scatter transpose ==
  gather (analytic vjp), and TDMA grad == central FD (≤1e-6). Reuse `ops.scatter_add`
  (masked `segment_sum`, −1→0 in fwd **and** grad) and `ops.tdma` (two `lax.scan`
  sweeps) — do not re-derive.

## Phase 2 — Minimal forward step on pi

- **[IC] ⚠️ The pi reference dump is NOT a constant T=10/S=35 IC — it is constant +
  a Gaussian T-blob.** `fesom_main.c:744-753` adds `fesom_ic_tracer_T_blob` on top of
  the constant IC whenever no PHC path is given (the dump run gives none). The blob:
  centre (lon0,lat0)=(−45°,40°) geographic, σ_h=10°, σ_z=300 m, amp=+5 °C, added
  **additively** to T on every wet layer, with a **4σ horizontal cutoff** (`if r²_h >
  16: continue`) and a small-circle `cos(lat0)` correction (`fesom_ic.c:82-129`). S
  stays 35. **Consequence:** any kernel whose verification depends on T/S (EOS at
  substep 1, hence pressure → PGF → momentum → everything downstream) must reproduce
  the blob, not the bare constant. Probe 1001 sits inside the blob (stratified →
  bvfreq≠0); probe 3000 is outside (T=10, bvfreq=0). The constant-IC claim in
  `REFERENCE_RUNS.md`/the plan is the *base*; the blob is the actual field. *(Found
  while starting Task 2.1: density[0] differed across probes and bvfreq was nonzero —
  impossible under a truly constant IC.)*

- **[IC] T/S are effectively frozen over the 10 dumped steps.** Constant S and a
  smooth T-blob under analytical-wind-only forcing (no heat/water flux) drive only weak
  flow; density at substep 1 is identical to ~5 digits across steps 1–10. So substep-1
  EOS fields are step-independent in this config — a convenient but weak (no horizontal
  T/S evolution) gate. Horizontal-variation stress comes later (FCT / CORE2).

- **[eos] The substep-1 N² smoother (`fesom_smooth_nod3D`, single sweep) is an
  element→node area-weighted patch average; the dump's bvfreq is POST-smooth.** Per
  element el and level nz∈[ulevels[el]-1, nlevels[el]-1], scatter
  `area_el·(bv[v0]+bv[v1]+bv[v2])` to all 3 vertices; divide node sums by `3·Σarea`.
  The element's level range is always ⊆ its vertices' ranges (node nlevels = MAX over
  cells, ulevels = MIN), so the per-element clamp = `elem_iface_mask` and no extra
  node-side level clamp is needed (`fesom_eos.c:226-277`, `fesom_step.c:92`). Scatter
  class → ~1e-12. **Verified load-bearing**: raw N² *fails* the probe gate (rel ~1.1),
  smoothed *passes* (rel ~3e-16) — always test that a "decorative-looking" smoothing
  pass actually moves the field at the probe before trusting a green gate.

- **[eos] A pointwise map kernel can match C *bit-for-bit* (max|Δ|=0), not just
  ~1e-15.** The JM-EOS `density` column matched the dump exactly — Horner-form
  polynomial, identical constants, no scatter/reduction to reassociate. Useful
  expectation: for a pure pointwise map, a *nonzero* diff signals a real bug (wrong
  constant/association), not FP noise. `pressure` (a downward cumsum) lands at ~1e-11
  abs / 1e-16 rel — the sequential integration, near-exact. (Task 2.1, `eos.py`.)

- **[eos/AD] The unused `nz=0` N² level is a div-by-zero → NaN-gradient trap.** N²[nz]
  needs the `nz-1` layer; at `nz=0` there is none. A naive `0/0` there produces NaN
  that `jnp.where`-masking does NOT stop in the *backward* pass (NaN·0 = NaN). Fix:
  edge-replicate the level shift so ρ_up==ρ_dn at nz=0 (→ N²=0) and set the unused
  `zdiff[0]=1` to keep the divide finite. General rule: make masked-off lanes compute a
  *finite* value, don't rely on the forward mask to hide a NaN. (`eos.py:_shift_down`.)

- **[eos] N² surface/bottom interface padding vectorizes as a clip-gather.** C does
  `bvfreq[nzmin]=bvfreq[nzmin+1]; bvfreq[nzmax]=bvfreq[nzmax-1]`. Equivalent to
  `take_along_axis(bv, clip(arange(nl), nzmin+1, nzmax-1))` then mask to
  `node_iface_mask` — one op, per-node bounds, no scatter. (`eos.py:pressure_bv`.)

- **[pgf] Element dumps verify element kernels DIRECTLY — ignore the plan's older
  "indirect via ssh_rhs" hedges.** The C dump writer (Path A) records `pgf_x/y`,
  `uv_rhs`, `uv`, `Av` at element probes (first cell incident to each node probe:
  1757/2656/3688/4604/5575). PGF matched at all 5 to ~1e-20 abs (`gather` class).
  (Task 2.2, `pgf.py`.)

- **[verify] For fields whose tail values decay to numerical zero (~1e-20), the
  *relative* error is meaningless — the `atol` floor is what gates.** PGF deep-level
  diffs showed rel ~1e+287 (tiny-abs ÷ tinier-c) yet PASS because `|Δ|≤atol+rtol·|c|`
  with atol=1e-14 covers them. This is exactly why the gate is the isclose form, not a
  pure relative test. Don't panic at a huge `rel=` in the report if `max|Δ|` is ~atol.

- **[pp/masks] PP/convection write a THIRD level-range class: interior interfaces
  `[nzmin+1, nzmax)`.** Not the layer range `[nzmin,nzmax)` and not the full interface
  range `[nzmin,nzmax]` — `Kv`/`Av` are left **0** at the surface (`nzmin`) and bottom
  (`nzmax`) interfaces because the PP loops run `nz` from `nzmin+1` to `<nzmax`. The
  dump confirms: `Kv=[0, 1e-5, …, 1e-5, 0]`. Build this mask as
  `(k>=ulevels) & (k<nlevels-1)`; don't reuse `iface_mask`. (`fesom_pp.c:105`.)

- **[pp] The 3-loop order is load-bearing — compute the dimensionless `factor` ONCE.**
  C overwrites `Kv` with `factor = shear²/(shear²+5·max(N²,0)+1e-14)`, builds
  `Av = mix·mean(factor²)+A_ver` from THAT, *then* overwrites `Kv = mix·factor³+K_ver`.
  Av uses `factor²`, Kv uses `factor³` — if you compute Av from the final Kv you get
  the wrong viscosity. In JAX: compute `factor`, derive both from it. (`fesom_pp.c:62-145`.)

- **[verify/method] A step-1 dump gate is WEAK for any kernel that depends on
  velocity** — uv=0 at rest, so PP's shear path, momentum advection, etc. collapse to
  trivial background. Exercise the dormant path with a **synthetic-input unit test
  against an independent (loop-based, different-code-path) reference**, plus a
  later-step re-verification once the full `step()` exists (Task 2.11). A green step-1
  gate alone does NOT mean the kernel is right. (Tasks 2.3, 2.4 both hit this:
  momentum at rest collapses to `uv_rhs = −dt·pgf`.)

- **[momentum] The AB-slot read/overwrite order is load-bearing.** `compute_vel_rhs`
  (i) shifts the **OLD** `uv_rhsAB` into `uv_rhs` (`ab1·AB_old`), then (iii) **overwrites**
  `uv_rhsAB` with this step's Coriolis `(v·ff, −u·ff)`, then advection **adds** into that
  NEW slot, then assembly reads the NEW slot. In JAX: keep `AB_old` (input) and build a
  fresh `AB_new`; never alias. (`fesom_momentum.c:82-119`.)

- **[momentum] Momentum advection (momadv_opt=2) is TWO scatters, not one.** Vertical:
  element→node area-weighted interface-velocity scatter, ×`w_e`, then −d/dz over
  `3·hnode`. Horizontal: an **antisymmetric edge→node** scatter (`n1 += flux`,
  `n2 −= flux` — scatter `[+flux,−flux]` to `edges`). Then /`areasvol`, then
  vertex→element area·mean/3. The edge-replicated down-shift `0.5(u[j]+u[j−1])`
  *automatically* yields the C's surface term `u[0]` at `j=0` (since 0.5(u0+u0)=u0) —
  no special-case needed for non-cavity. (`fesom_momentum.c:156-271`.)

- **[verify/method] For an intricate multi-scatter kernel, transcribe the C loops
  verbatim into a numpy reference and diff against it with SYNTHETIC nonzero inputs.**
  Far stronger than the (rest-trivial) dump gate, and a different code path so shared
  bugs are unlikely. The momentum reference (~90 lines, loop-for-loop) caught nothing
  here only because the vectorization was right — but it's the gate that *would* catch a
  sign/index slip in the edge scatter. (Task 2.4, `test_momentum.py::_ref`.)

- **[AD] Use the double-`where` "safe sqrt" for any `sqrt(x)` that can hit x=0 —
  forward-identical, gradient finite.** `safe = where(x>0, x, 1); return where(x>0,
  sqrt(safe), 0)`. Plain `sqrt(0)` is fine forward but its grad is `1/(2·0)=∞`, and a
  downstream `where`/`max` that masks the value does NOT mask the NaN in the backward
  pass. The flow-aware biharmonic viscosity depends on `|∇u|=sqrt(|du|²)` (kink at
  rest) — without safe-sqrt the *whole* gradient is NaN at uv=0. Verified with a
  no-NaN-grad-at-rest test. Same pattern already used in `eos.py` for the unused N²
  level. (Task 2.5, `momentum.py:_safe_sqrt`.)

- **[visc] The biharmonic `visc_filt_bidiff` is two edge→element antisymmetric
  scatters with a shared per-edge `coef`.** Stage 1 builds the flow-aware Laplacian
  `U_c/V_c` at elements (`U_c[el1]-=u1·coef`, `+=` at el2); stage 2 scatters
  `-dt·coef·(U_c[el1]-U_c[el2])/area` back into `uv_rhs`. INTERIOR edges only (both
  `el1,el2≥0`) — boundary edges contribute nothing (the −1 sentinel + the level
  mask both zero them). Per-edge level range is the OVERLAP
  `[max(ulevels)-1, min(nlevels)-1)`, not either element's own range.
  (`fesom_momentum.c:654-762`.)

- **[forcing] ⚠️ The wind stress `impl_vert_visc` reads is DOUBLE-AVERAGED, not the
  raw cos pattern.** `set_analytical` writes the raw element stress AND an
  area-weighted node average; then `oce_fluxes_mom` (`fesom_ice_coupling.c:256`, run
  EVERY step before the ocean step via `fesom_main.c:983`, even with no ice — the ice
  blend is a no-op at `a_ice=0`) OVERWRITES the element stress with the **simple mean
  of the 3 vertices' node stresses**. So: raw elem → area-weighted node → simple-mean
  elem. Feeding the raw stress is a ~5e-4 surface-velocity error. A cross-module
  dependency hiding in the *ice* coupling file — easy to miss. (`forcing.py`, Task 2.6.)

- **[verify/diag] When ONE velocity component fails at ONE row and the other passes,
  the matrix/solve is correct and that component's FORCING is wrong.** The TDMA `v`
  matched the dump exactly while `u` failed only at the surface row — instantly
  localizing the bug to the u-only surface wind stress (not the solve, geometry, or
  drag). Per-component, per-row failure structure is a precise debugging signal.
  (Task 2.6.)

- **[tdma] Pad the per-column TDMA to full `nl` with `(b=1, a=c=0, d=0)` below the
  bottom → those rows solve to 0 and don't corrupt the real system.** The bottom valid
  row has `c=0` (no downward coupling) and the first pad row has `a=0` (no upward
  coupling), so `ops.tdma` over all `nl` rows gives the same answer as the C's
  `[nzmin,nzmax)` loop. Phase-2 simplifications that made this tractable: `w_i=0`
  (advective tridiagonal terms vanish) and no partial cells (`zbar_n=zbar`, `Z_n=Z`
  globally, computed once and broadcast). (`momentum.py:impl_vert_visc`, Task 2.6.)

- **[ssh/solver] ⚠️ The C CG stops at a LOOSE `soltol=1e-5`, so the dumped `d_eta` is
  the EARLY-STOPPED iterate — NOT the converged solution.** On pi `cond(S)≈800`, so PCG
  hits `‖r‖<soltol·‖b‖` in just **3 iterations** (residuals `[65, 1.0, 0.015]` vs
  `rtol=0.197`); the early iterate is ~2e-9 from the exact `S⁻¹b`. **Consequence: to
  match the dump you MUST replicate the C PCG (same static `S`, same MITgcm
  preconditioner, same `x0`, same stop) — converging *tight* gives a DIFFERENT `d_eta`
  (off ~2e-10 @ probe 1001, rel 2.5e-6 → fails the gate).** The replicated 3-iter PCG
  matches the dump to **~1e-18**. The huge residual margin (iter 2 is 5× above, iter 3
  is 13× below the threshold) makes the iteration count robust to `segment_sum`
  reassociation. *(The plan's "≤1e-12" gate is met by `d_eta`; the early-stop replication
  is what makes it possible.)* (`fesom_ssh.c:407-412,484`, Task 2.7.)

- **[ssh/AD] `custom_linear_solve` cleanly decouples a dump-matching forward from an
  accurate gradient via SEPARATE `solve`/`transpose_solve`.** Reverse-mode AD uses ONLY
  `transpose_solve` for the cotangent, so: forward `solve` = early-stopped PCG (matches
  the dump), `transpose_solve` = *tight* PCG → the gradient is the clean implicit-diff
  `S⁻¹·x̄` regardless of the loose forward stop. Verified: AD cotangent == an independent
  tight `S⁻¹w` (rel 2e-14) == central-FD, and is finite. The forward value and the
  gradient genuinely have different fidelity needs (dump-match vs accuracy); don't force
  one solver to serve both. (`ssh.solve_ssh`, Task 2.7.)

- **[ssh/precond] The MITgcm symmetric preconditioner is LOAD-BEARING — test that a
  Jacobi variant FAILS the dump.** Because the dump is the early-stopped iterate, the
  preconditioner (which shapes the Krylov path) directly changes `d_eta`. Zeroing the
  19336 off-diagonal `pr` entries (→ Jacobi) shifts `d_eta` by 2.9e-10 @ probe 1001 →
  fails the dump. Same discipline as the bvfreq-smoother: prove the "looks like a detail"
  pass actually moves the gated field. `pr[diag]=1/diag`, `pr[off]=−0.5·(S[r,c]/diag_r)/
  (diag_r+diag_c)` — off-diagonal, applied as a sparse matvec, not a diagonal scaling.
  (`fesom_ssh.c:239-253`, `ssh.ssh_precond`, Task 2.7.)

- **[ssh/rhs] `ssh_rhs` is a near-cancelling transport divergence → its abs floor is
  upstream `du` amplified by geometry (`dx·helem ~ 1e7`), NOT the ssh_rhs scatter.** The
  wind-forced convergence is a small residual of large opposing edge fluxes (~1e4), so at
  cancellation nodes (probe 1500: value 1.13) the abs diff vs the dump is ~5e-9 (rel ~4e-9)
  while at constructive nodes (probe 1001: value 2.8e4) it's rel ~1e-14. A
  numpy-*sequential* reference AND `segment_sum` both land ~5e-9 vs the dump — same floor,
  so it's the shared upstream `du` (~1e-12 rel) ×`dx·helem`, not the scatter order. Gate at
  **atol 1e-7**, not 1e-12; the relative error at cancellation nodes is meaningless.
  (`ssh.compute_ssh_rhs`, Task 2.7.)

- **[ssh/static-op] In linfs the stiffness operator is STATIC: the "−g·dt·α·hbar" factor
  uses the FIXED `zbar` depths, never the evolving `hbar`.** `depth = zbar[nlevels-1] −
  zbar[0] < 0` IS the `−hbar` (full static column depth); the positive `factor=g·dt·α·θ`
  carries the magnitude. So `update_stiff_mat_ale` is gated off (`fesom_ssh.c:9-12`), the
  operator is assembled ONCE (host scipy COO→CSR → a `segment_sum` matvec reused every
  step), and AD is clean (the operator carries no differentiable/evolving dependence — the
  whole `d(d_eta)/d(params)` path is through the rhs). Per-step rebuild is a Phase-5/zlevel
  concern. (`fesom_ssh.c:120-145`, `ssh.build_ssh_operator`, Task 2.7.)

- **[ssh/warmstart] The C warm-starts the CG from the previous step's `d_eta` (it's never
  zeroed between steps — only inited at `fesom_ic.c:57`).** Step-1 `x0=0` (a clean *linear*
  solve, ideal for `custom_linear_solve`). For step ≥2 the warm start makes the
  early-stopped iterate depend on `x0`, which would make the inner `solve` non-linear; keep
  it linear by folding the warm start into the rhs (`b_eff = b − A·stop_gradient(x0)`, solve
  `δ` from 0, return `x0+δ`). The *solution* is `x0`-independent — only the early-stop
  iterate isn't — so `stop_gradient(x0)` is correct. Exact warm-start dump-matching at step
  ≥2 (the C's stop threshold uses the original `‖b‖`) is finalized with the full `step()` in
  Task 2.11. (`ssh.solve_ssh`, Task 2.7.)

- **[hbar] ⚠️ `compute_hbar`'s `ssh_rhs_old` IS `compute_ssh_rhs` with `uv_rhs=0` and
  `alpha=1` — reuse it, don't re-port.** Substep 11's transport divergence
  (`fesom_momentum.c:796-830`) is the byte-identical antisymmetric edge→node scatter as
  substep 8 (`fesom_ssh.c:261`); the *only* differences are it uses the bare **new** velocity
  `u` (not `u+u_rhs`) and drops the `alpha` factor (`alpha=1`). So
  `ssh_rhs_old = compute_ssh_rhs(mesh, uv, zeros_like(uv), helem, alpha=1.0)` is exact. Edge
  range is `myDim_edge2D` (the C warns the `+eDim` double-count → CG NaN ~step 85-95 in MPI)
  but for single-rank pi `myDim_edge2D == edge2D == 8986`, so the all-edges JAX scatter is
  identical. (`ssh.compute_hbar`, Task 2.8.)

- **[hbar/fidelity] A downstream `÷ (large area)` RESTORES tight fidelity that the
  intermediate scatter lost — gate the OUTPUT, not the noisy intermediate.** `hbar =
  hbar_old + ssh_rhs_old·dt / areasvol[n,0]`. `ssh_rhs_old` is the *same* near-cancelling
  transport-divergence scatter as `ssh_rhs` (abs floor ~1e-7, amplified by `dx·helem~1e7`),
  yet `hbar` matches the dump to **~1e-17 absolute** — because `areasvol ~ 1e9–1e12 m²`
  divides that amplified error right back down (`1e-7·100/1e10 ~ 1e-15`). So the substeps
  10–12 dump gates are TIGHT (uv ~2e-17, hbar/eta_n ~1e-17), unlike the loose `ssh_rhs` gate
  (atol 1e-7). Moral: don't inherit an upstream field's loose tolerance — re-measure at the
  gated field; a `÷area`/average can recover map-class fidelity. (`ssh.compute_hbar`, Task 2.8.)

- **[update_vel] The SSH-gradient correction `(Fx,Fy)=∇N·(−gθdt·d_eta)` is BAROTROPIC
  (uniform over the column) and `uv` ACCUMULATES (`uv += du + F`).** `Fx,Fy` are a single
  per-element scalar added to *every* layer `nz∈[nzmin,nzmax)` (broadcast over `nz`), unlike
  the per-level increment `du` (`fesom_momentum.c:496-500`). At step 1 `uv=0` so this is the
  first wind-driven velocity (~1e-3 surface); at step ≥2 it increments the carried `uv`. uv
  matched the dump ~2e-17 (gather class) since both `du` (~1e-17) and the replicated
  early-stop `d_eta` (~1e-18) are near-exact. `d_eta` is *read* here, not consumed — it stays
  as the next step's CG warm-start `x0`. (`momentum.update_vel`, Task 2.8.)

- **[eta_n] With `SSH_ALPHA=1` the eta_n blend collapses to `eta_n = hbar` exactly** (the
  dump confirms `eta_n == hbar` at every probe). `eta_n = α·hbar + (1−α)·hbar_old`
  (`fesom_step.c:257-268`); the `(1−α)·hbar_old` term vanishes at `α=1` (same shape as the
  `ssh_rhs`'s `(1−α)·ssh_rhs_old` blend). Keep the blend form for generality, but in Phase 2
  `eta_n` is a renamed copy of the post-update `hbar`. Only non-cavity nodes
  (`ulevels_nod2D==1`, all of pi) are written; cavity nodes keep their prior `eta_n`.
  (`ssh.eta_n_update`, Task 2.8.)

- **[ale] ⚠️ `w` (substep 13) is the PER-LEVEL sibling of the ssh_rhs/hbar scatter —
  reuse the flux, keep it per-level, then reverse-cumsum + ÷area.** Same antisymmetric
  edge→node `(v·dx − u·dy)·helem` transport divergence as `compute_ssh_rhs`/`compute_hbar`
  (`alpha=1`, bare new `uv`, no AB-velocity), but NOT summed over levels — keep the
  `[edge,nl]` term, scatter `[+c,−c]→[n1,n2]` per level, then (3) a reverse bottom→top
  cumulative sum, then (4) ÷ area. (`fesom_ale.c:104-187`, `ale.compute_w`, Task 2.9.)

- **[ale] ⚠️ Stage-4 divides by `mesh.area` (upper-edge scalar CV area), NOT `areasvol`
  (which `compute_hbar` used) — they are DIFFERENT arrays.** Easy to grab the wrong one
  since both are `[nod2D,nl]` CV-area fields and the surrounding code (hbar) just used
  `areasvol`. The C is explicit: `w /= mesh->area[FESOM_NODE3D(n,nz,nl)]` with the
  `if (a>0)` guard → mirror as `safe_area = where(area>0, area, 1.0)` (AD-finite; the only
  nonzero `w` lanes are `[nzmin,nzmax)` where `area>0`, so it's exact). (`fesom_ale.c:178`,
  Task 2.9.)

- **[ale] The full reverse suffix-sum `lax.cumsum(div, axis=1, reverse=True)` == the C's
  bounded `for nz=nzmax-1..nzmin: w[nz]+=w[nz+1]` loop — for free.** Because the per-level
  scatter is masked to `elem_layer_mask` and every element's layer range ⊆ its vertices'
  node range (node nlevels=MAX, ulevels=MIN over cells), `div` is already 0 at and below
  each node's bottom interface `nzmax` — so the suffix-sum naturally preserves the no-flux
  BC `w[nzmax]=0` and equals the bounded loop. Mask the final `w` with `node_iface_mask` to
  zero a cavity node's suffix-sum spill above `nzmin` (a no-op for non-cavity pi, but
  correct in general). Verified `w[nzmax]==0` exactly at every node. (`ale.compute_w`, Task 2.9.)

- **[ale/fidelity] Like `hbar`, the ÷area (1e9–1e12 m²) crushes the near-cancelling
  divergence floor — `w` matches the dump ~4e-20 on CPU (a TIGHT, hbar-class gate), not the
  loose ssh_rhs-class ~1e-7.** Even though the per-level `div` carries the same amplified
  cancellation floor as `ssh_rhs` (`dx·helem~1e7`), the reverse cumsum's partial
  cancellation + the ÷area divide it back to ~1e-20. Step 1 is a REAL gate (post-`update_vel`
  `uv` is the first wind-driven ~1e-3 velocity → `w` ~1e-6, non-trivial). Synthetic O(0.1)
  uv vs a numpy loop ref agrees to ~1e-18 (rel ~3e-16); `w` is LINEAR in `uv` so AD==central
  FD exactly and is finite at uv=0. Gate at `W_ATOL=1e-12` (hbar precedent, GPU-safe).
  (`test_ale.py`, Task 2.9.)

- **[ale] `hnode_new = hnode` bit-for-bit in linfs (dh/dt=0, a memcpy) — confirms
  `State.rest().hnode` (the `zbar_3d_n` differences) EQUALS the C's static `hnode` exactly.**
  The substep-13 node dump of `hnode_new` matched `State.rest().hnode` to max|Δ|=0 at all 5
  probes (top layer 5 m, deepest ~250 m). The `helem` recompute + `hnode = hnode_new` commit
  is `fesom_ale_commit_thickness` = substep **16** (Task 2.10), NOT substep 13 — the plan's
  Task-2.9 "and helem" wording predates the substep map; 2.9 is strictly `w`+`hnode_new`.
  (`fesom_ale.c:10-16`, `ale.thickness_linfs`, Task 2.9.)

- **[ale/config] `use_wsplit=0` in Phase 2 ⇒ `w_e = w`, `w_i = 0` (no vertical-velocity
  split).** `fesom_ale_compute_wvel_split` (`fesom_ale.c:241`) reduces to a copy when
  `use_wsplit=0` (`fesom_constants.h:56`, off for the linfs reference runs — the split was
  what seeded a Fortran day-92 blow-up). So the `w` from substep 13 IS `w_e` (read by tracer
  advection, Task 2.10) and `w_i=0` confirms the Task-2.6 `impl_vert_visc` simplification
  (`w_i=0` ⇒ advective tridiagonal terms drop). `cfl_z`/`w_e`/`w_i`/`wvel_split` have no
  substep-13 dump → ported when consumed (Task 2.10/2.11), not here. (Task 2.9.)

## Phase 2 — tracers (Task 2.10, substeps 15–16)

- **[tracers/upwind] The horizontal upwind flux's 5 level-"zones" collapse to a masked
  per-element sum.** The C (`adv_tra_hor_upw1`, `fesom_tracer_adv.c:212`) splits each edge's
  column into 5 zones (el1-only-above / el2-only-above / both / el1-only-below /
  el2-only-below) purely to walk the union of the two cells' level ranges — vectorized this
  is just `vflux = mask₁·flux₁ + mask₂·flux₂` per level (each masked to `elem_layer_mask`).
  ⚠️ The per-element flux is the **NEGATION** of `compute_w`/`compute_ssh_rhs`'s term: el1
  uses `(u·dy₁ − v·dx₁)·h`, el2 `(v·dx₂ − u·dy₂)·h`. Upwind face value
  `-½(T₁(vflux+|vflux|) + T₂(vflux−|vflux|))` (the `|vflux|` is an AD kink, finite-grad).
  (`tracer_adv.adv_flux_hor`, Task 2.10.)

- **[tracers] Advection fluxes use `ttfAB` (AB2-extrapolated), but the ALE reconstruction
  updates `values` (T).** `init_tracers_AB_one` (`fesom_tracer_adv.c:174`) computes
  `ttfAB = -(0.5+ε)·valuesold + (1.5+ε)·values` (ε=0.1) and saves `valuesold := values`. At
  **step 1** `valuesold == values` (`ic` sets `T_old=T`) ⇒ `ttfAB == T`. Functional JAX:
  `advect_one` returns `(T_new, T_old_new=T)`; the caller sets the next step's `T_old`. The
  edge-replicated `T_above = T[nz-1]` makes the unified vertical formula reproduce the C's
  surface flux `-w·T·area` at `nzmin` (½·2w·T). (`tracer_adv`, Task 2.10.)

- **[tracers/constant] ⚠️ A constant tracer is preserved EXACTLY (bit-exact 0.0 on CPU) —
  this is the discrete-continuity consistency, and the reason `S=35` is the clean step-1
  gate.** The vertical divergence (via `w` = reverse-cumsum of the horizontal transport
  divergence ÷area, so `w·area` reconstructs that very divergence) and the direct horizontal
  edge scatter **cancel bit-exactly** because both reuse `ops.scatter_add` on the same edges
  with exactly-negated per-edge values. (GPU may leave ~1e-12 if the two `segment_sum`s
  reassociate differently — gate `S` at `kind="scatter"`.) (`test_tracers.py`, Task 2.10.)

- **[tracers/dump] ⚠️ The C dump runs FCT; this port runs UPWIND. `S=35` (constant) matches
  the dump bit-for-bit; `T` (the blob) differs by ~3e-7 = the limited antidiffusive flux —
  the tight `T` match is a Phase-4 (FCT) gate.** So gate `S` vs the dump (tight), verify
  upwind `T` against an independent numpy loop reference (bit-exact) + the constant-tracer
  property, and only *bound* `T` vs the dump (`< 1e-5`). This **corrects** the REFERENCE_RUNS
  "at step 1 the field is horizontally constant" claim — the **T-blob is not constant**; only
  `S` is. (`test_tracers.py`, Task 2.10.)

- **[tracers/diff] The vertical tracer diffusion is `impl_vert_visc`'s per-NODE 1-unknown
  sibling**, with two differences: an extra `area[iface]/areasvol[layer]` geometric ratio on
  the off-diagonals, and a **`hnode_new` mass diagonal** (`b = -a - c + hnode_new`, vs
  momentum's `+1`). Phase-2 reductions (all verified): `gm=NULL` ⇒ no Redi `K33`; `do_wimpl=0`;
  `bc_surface=0` (analytical forcing ⇒ zero heat/water/virtual-salt/relax-salt flux); `sw_3d=0`
  (`USE_SW_PENE` is gated on `use_jra`, off for analytical — `fesom_main.c:992`); full-cell linfs
  ⇒ `Z_n=Z`. Conserves `Σ areasvol·hnode·T` to ~1e-16; reuse `ops.tdma`.
  (`tracer_diff.impl_vert_diff_one`, `fesom_tracer_diff.c:85`, Task 2.10.)

- **[tracers/diff/AD] ⚠️ The `Z`-padding's exact 0 poisons `d/d(Kv)` (0·inf = NaN) — replace
  `dZ==0` with 1.** `Zp = concat([Z, Z[-1:]])` makes `dZ_dn[nl-2] = Z[nl-2]−Z[nl-2] = 0` at an
  always-masked lane; `c_full = …/dZ_dn` is `inf`/`NaN` there, which the forward `where`
  masks but whose **infinite local derivative × the where's 0 cotangent = NaN** in the
  backward pass (the masked value is finite, the *gradient* is not). Fix:
  `dZ = where(dZ==0, 1, dZ)` so the masked lanes are finite both ways. Same class as the eos
  unused-N²-level trap; `impl_vert_visc` has the same latent pattern but its `bot`-zeroing
  dodges it. Diffusion is linear in T (AD==FD) and `d/d(Kv)` matches FD where resolvable
  (FD underflows at the ~1e-5 gradient entries). (`tracer_diff`, Task 2.10.)

- **[ale] `commit_thickness` (substep 16) = `hnode:=hnode_new` + `helem = ⅓Σ_vertices hnode`.**
  Both static in linfs: the `hnode` node dump is bit-for-bit (like substep-13 `hnode_new`) and
  the recomputed `helem` equals `State.rest().helem` exactly. (`fesom_ale.c:18`,
  `ale.commit_thickness`, Task 2.10.)

## Phase 2 — assembled step() (Task 2.11, GATE 2)

- **[step/warmstart] ⚠️ The CG warm-start measures the residual against the ORIGINAL
  `‖ssh_rhs‖`, NOT the deflated `‖b_eff‖` — this is the step-≥2 fidelity the ssh lesson
  deferred to 2.11.** `solve_ssh` folds the warm start into `b_eff = ssh_rhs − A·x0` and
  solves δ from 0, but the C's early-stop threshold is `soltol·‖ssh_rhs‖`. Since the inner
  residual `b_eff − A·δ_k` equals the full residual `ssh_rhs − A·(x0+δ_k)`, passing
  `rtol_abs = soltol·‖ssh_rhs‖/√N` to the inner PCG replicates the C's warm-started
  early-stop exactly (a good warm start ⇒ `b_eff` already below threshold ⇒ 0 iters ⇒
  `d_eta=x0`); deriving rtol from `‖b_eff‖` over-converges. **Verified LOAD-BEARING:** step-2
  `d_eta` matches the dump 3–3000× better warm-started than from `x0=0`. (`ssh.solve_ssh`
  `rtol_abs`, Task 2.11.)

- **[step/multistep] ⚠️ A TIGHT multi-step dump match is impossible with upwind — `T`
  diverges ~3e-7 at step 1 (upwind vs the dump's FCT) and cascades via `density` into every
  T-dependent field at step ≥2** (density ~6e-8 → momentum/SSH ~1e-10, `ssh_rhs` ~1e-2 after
  the `dx·helem~1e7` amplification). So **step 1 is the tight integration gate** (one `step()`
  reproduces ALL per-kernel substep gates at the probes — confirms the order + threading),
  and step ≥2 is gated by INVARIANTS instead: `S` stays **exactly 35** (constant-tracer
  preservation — a sensitive AB2/threading check, a bug corrupts it), rest-state to machine
  precision, climate-close SSH/velocity, 100-step stability. The tight multi-step `T/S` match
  is a Phase-4 (FCT) gate. (`test_step_pi.py`, Task 2.11.)

- **[step/threading] The between-step bookkeeping (the whole point of 2.11):** `hbar_old`
  saved before `compute_hbar` overwrites `hbar`; `d_eta` carried as the next CG warm-start
  (**never zeroed between steps** — `fesom_main.c:570`'s `memset(d_eta)` is a one-time
  `do_sanity` CG self-test, NOT the time loop); `uv_rhsAB` (momentum) and `T_old`/`S_old`
  (tracers, from `advect_one`) are the AB2 histories; `eta_n`/`w_e` feed `compute_vel_rhs`
  **lagged** (previous step's). `is_first_step` only flips the AB2 `ff_step` (1.0 vs 1.6).
  (`step.step`, `fesom_step.c`, Task 2.11.)

- **[step/rest] Rest state (constant T/S, NO blob, zero wind) stays at rest to machine
  precision** (`max|uv|`~2e-16 after 5 steps; T/S exactly constant). Constant T/S ⇒
  horizontally constant density (depth-varying but identical per column) ⇒ PGF=0 ⇒ no flow;
  advection/diffusion of a constant field = 0. The fundamental no-spurious-flow gate — use a
  **zero** `stress_surf` (the analytical wind is nonzero). (`test_step_pi.py`, Task 2.11.)

- **[step/jit] XLA FMA-contracts the EOS density polynomial ⇒ the jitted step's `density`
  shifts ~1e-13 from the eager bit-exact value — past the `map` gate (1e-14).** So the TIGHT
  bit-exact step-1 gates run on **eager** `step()`; the jitted `step_jit` (the production /
  `lax.scan` entry, `static_argnames=(dt, is_first_step)` ⇒ 2 compiled variants) matches eager
  to ~1e-12 (FMA level), which is fine for the loose multi-step/stability gates. 100 steps:
  `max|uv|`~0.075, `|eta|`~0.35 m, no NaN, `S` exactly 35. (`step.step_jit`/`run`, Task 2.11.)

## Phase 3 — AD smoke test (Tasks 3.1/3.2, GATE 3)

- **[ad/eos] ⚠️ The `bvfreq` (N²) bottom-padding `1/zdiff` is a BACKWARD-ONLY NaN trap —
  the forward gate passed for two phases while the gradient was NaN.** `zdiff = Zd − Zp` is
  exactly 0 at **two** unused interfaces: the surface (`k=0`, edge-replicated) AND the
  **bottom padding** (`Zp = concat([Z, Z[-1:]])` duplicates `Z[-1]` in its tail ⇒
  `zdiff[bottom]=0`). `1/zdiff=inf` there ⇒ `bv[:,bottom]=inf` in the *forward* pass, but the
  output `take_along_axis(bv, clip(k,lo,hi))` **clips those lanes away**, so the forward
  bvfreq (and every Phase-0..2 gate) is correct. The backward pass, however, computes
  `0·inf = NaN` (the masked lane's 0 cotangent × the inf local derivative) and it flows to
  `d(loss)/d(T)` at exactly the `nl-2`/`nl-1` columns of *every* node (= 2·nod2D = 6280 lanes
  on pi). The old fix `zdiff.at[0].set(1.0)` only patched the surface. Fix:
  `zdiff = where(zdiff==0, 1, zdiff)` (covers both; forward unchanged — the lanes are clipped
  out). Same class as `tracer_diff`'s `where(dZ==0,1,dZ)` and the eos unused-`nz=0` trap; the
  rule "make masked-off lanes compute a FINITE value, don't trust the forward mask to hide a
  backward NaN" bit a THIRD time. (`eos.pressure_bv`, Task 3.2.)

- **[ad/method] ⚠️ `d/d(scalar param)` being finite does NOT prove `d/d(field)` is finite —
  the IC-field gradient is the strictly stronger masked-NaN probe.** `d(loss)/d(k_ver)` was
  finite (and FD-correct!) while `d(loss)/d(T₀)` was NaN, because the NaN lived in the
  `T₀→eos→bvfreq` backward at the masked lanes, and `k_ver` enters **additively** downstream
  (`Kv = mix·factor³ + k_ver` ⇒ `d/dk_ver` only needs `d(loss)/d(Kv)`, never `d(Kv)/d(bvfreq)`),
  so it never traverses the poisoned sub-path. Earlier per-kernel grad checks differentiated
  w.r.t. T at a *single wet node* and missed it. **Always include a `grad` w.r.t. a full IC
  field (incl. the below-bottom padding) — it is the test that catches these.** (Task 3.2.)

- **[scan/checkpoint] `integrate` (run step 1 eagerly with `is_first_step=True`, then
  `lax.scan` steps 2..N with `is_first_step=False` baked in) == the Phase-2 `run` loop
  BIT-IDENTICAL, and `jax.checkpoint` is forward-transparent (on==off exactly).** The
  `is_first_step`-outside-the-scan pattern keeps the scan body uniform with no traced bool;
  closing over the loop-invariant `mesh`/`op`/`stress_surf`/`params` keeps the carry minimal
  (just `State`). `scan(jax.checkpoint(body))` differentiates correctly for closed-over
  tracers (`scan` hoists them as consts and sums their per-step cotangents), so
  `d(loss)/d(params)` accumulates over the window. Forward `integrate==run` to ~4e-19 (uv),
  0.0 elsewhere; checkpoint on/off forward Δ = 0.0; same gradient with/without checkpoint.
  (`integrate.py`, Task 3.1.)

- **[ad/fd] The end-to-end FD floor is set by the loss's INTERMEDIATE-SUM magnitude (mean
  SST ~10 ⇒ ~`eps·10` round-off), NOT by AD accuracy — and the plateau is at LARGE `h`.**
  `d(mean SST)/d(k_ver)` is ~−2.6e-3, so the FD signal `g·2h·k₀` at `k₀=1e-5,h=1e-4` is
  ~5e-12 vs a ~3e-15 round-off floor (SNR ~1700 ⇒ rel ~1.5e-4, marginal). Because the loss is
  very *smooth/near-linear* in `k_ver` (tiny truncation), the sweep's best `h` is the LARGEST
  (1e-3), and rel error *grows* as `h→0` (round-off): `[h=1e-3→6e-7, 1e-4→1e-5, 1e-5→1e-4,
  1e-6→2e-3, 1e-7→5e-3]`. Two robust levers (both keep the gradient identical): evaluate at a
  larger background `k_ver` (1e-4 ⇒ plateau 6e-7; 1e-3 ⇒ 4e-7) to lift the signal off the
  floor, and/or a longer window. Subtracting a constant from the loss does NOT help (the
  round-off is baked into the mean before the subtract). So the gate asserts the **plateau**
  (min over the `h`-sweep) at a signal-lifted `k_ver=1e-4`, and only checks finite+sign+loose
  -FD at the physical `k_ver=1e-5`. (`test_gradient.py`, Task 3.2.)

- **[ad/ml-hook] The differentiable-parameter seam = a `Params` pytree threaded
  `step(...,params) → pp.mixing_pp(...,k_ver,a_ver)`, with `params=None ⇒ Params.defaults()`
  (the config constants) — numerically transparent (the 274-test suite stays bit-identical).**
  This is the first concrete ML-hook (Phase 7 swaps the PP mixing for an NN here; its weights
  join `Params`). `k_ver` routes through the CG `custom_linear_solve` *across* steps
  (k_ver→Kv→diffusion→T→[next step]density→…→ssh_rhs→CG); `a_ver` routes through it *within* a
  step (a_ver→Av→impl_vert_visc→du→ssh_rhs→CG) — both FD-confirmed, so the implicit-diff
  transpose solve is proven on the assembled model. (`params.py`, `pp.py`, Task 3.2.)

- **[scan/memory] Checkpointing is LOAD-BEARING for the backward pass — N=200 pi backward is
  4.23 GB checkpointed vs 48.7 GB (OOM on A100-40) without.** Reverse-mode through the N-step
  loop needs O(N · per-step intermediates) un-checkpointed; XLA's `hlo_rematerialization`
  couldn't get it below 28 GiB and tried to alloc 48.7 GiB → `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. With
  per-step `jax.checkpoint` it is O(N · `State` carry) ≈ 4.23 GB (13% of the A100-40), compile
  +run 26 s. For *much* longer windows switch to nested/policy checkpointing (O(√N)); per-step
  remat suffices to N≥200. (`scripts/phase3_grad_memory.py`, GPU job 25378918, Task 3.1.)

- **[xla] The host-assembled static scatters (mesh indices baked as constants) trigger XLA
  constant-folding warnings (`scatter-add … taking > 2s`) at compile — benign, ~5 s each.**
  The grad-of-scan compile constant-folds a few `f64[3140,48,2]` scatter-adds with constant
  index operands; it's a compile-time/runtime trade-off, not a correctness issue (the run is
  correct and fast). Ignore the `slow_operation_alarm` lines. (GPU job 25378918, Task 3.1.)

## Phase 4 — FCT (Task 4.1, GATE-4 forward)

- **[ic] ⚠️⚠️ THE bug that ate the session: the C's step-1 `valuesold` (AB2 `T_old`) is the
  **pre-blob base constant T=10**, NOT the blob field.** `fesom_ic_tracers_constant` sets only
  `values` (`fesom_ic.c:62`); `valuesold` is `calloc`'d to 0 (`fesom_tracers.c:17`). Then
  `fesom_main.c:721` runs a rest-state `advect_one(T)` *sanity check* whose `init_tracers_AB_one`
  saves `valuesold = values = 10` — and ONLY THEN (`:748`) is the blob added to `values`. So at
  step 1, `T_old=10` (base), `values=10+blob`, and the AB2 extrapolation is
  `ttfAB = -(0.5+ε)·10 + (1.5+ε)·(10+blob)`, **not** `ttfAB = values`. Our `ic.initial_state`
  set `T_old=T` (the blob) — wrong. **This was mis-attributed for two phases as the
  "upwind−FCT gap" (~3e-7).** It contaminated BOTH upwind and FCT at step 1; the FCT `T` dump
  match jumps from 3.4e-7 → **1.8e-15** once `T_old` is the base. `S` (constant) is insensitive
  (a constant tracer is preserved for any `S_old`), which is why `S=35` matched all along and
  hid the bug. Fix: `ic.py` sets `T_old`/`S_old` to the masked pre-blob base. **Lesson: at step
  1, `T_old` need not equal `T`; chase a "gap" to its first principles before labelling it a
  scheme difference.** (`ic.py`, Task 4.1.)

- **[verify/method] ⚠️ A "faithful port" that matches your own numpy reference can STILL be
  wrong — they can share an INPUT bug. Dump the C's intermediates.** JAX FCT == numpy-C-ref
  FCT to ~1e-10 (stage-by-stage), and BOTH disagreed with the dump by 3e-7. The shared error
  was not in the formula (verified the qr4c against the C *and* the Fortran `oce_adv_tra_ver.F90`
  line-for-line — identical) but in the `ttfAB` *input* (the `T_old` bug above). The decisive
  move: add temporary `fesom_dump_record_node` calls in the C for the FCT intermediates
  (`fct_LO`, `adv_flux_ver` after the limiter) right after the T-advection (before S overwrites
  the scratch), rebuild, run with `FESOM_NO_TRDIFF=1` (isolates advection from diffusion). The
  C's `adf_v[surface] = -5.6e4` while ours was 0 (at step 1 `ttfAB=values` ⇒ surface adf=0) —
  working backward `adf=-(ttfAB-values)·W·area` gave `T_old=10`, cracking it. (Task 4.1.)

- **[fct] The FCT structure: `T_new = LO + limited(HO − LO)`. LO fluxes use `values` (T), HO
  uses `ttfAB`, the element/up-dn gradient uses `values`.** Driver `fesom_tracer_advect_one_fct`
  (`:1199`): (2) LO upwind fluxes from **values** (NOT ttfAB — unlike the upwind-only driver);
  (3) `compute_fct_LO` = the upwind ALE solution; (4) HO with `init_zero=0` ⇒ `adf := HO − LO`
  (horizontal MFCT 3rd-order `num_ord=0`, vertical QR4C 4th-order `num_ord=1`); (5) Zalesak
  limit; (6) `flux2dtracer_fct` adds the LO transition `-T·hnode + LO·hnode_new` + the limited
  antidiff divergence; (8) reconstruct. The algebra collapses to `T_new = LO + antidiff_div/
  areasvol/hnode_new`. For pi: no cavities (`ulevels≡1`), single rank (`myDim_edge2D==edge2D`).
  (`tracer_adv.advect_one_fct`, Task 4.1.)

- **[fct] A constant tracer is preserved by FCT (the gradients vanish ⇒ HO==LO, antidiff=0).**
  `tracer_gradient_elements` of a constant is 0 (∑∂N/∂x = 0, partition-of-unity), so the MFCT
  reconstruction `Tmean1=Tmean2=const` ⇒ HO flux == LO flux ⇒ `adf=0`, and the limiter clips
  nothing ⇒ `T_new = LO = const`. This is why `S=35` is the clean bit-for-bit FCT gate, exactly
  as in upwind. (Task 4.1.)

- **[fct/AD] The Zalesak limiter is differentiated as a SUBGRADIENT (option a) — finite & NaN
  -safe because the C's `flux_eps=1e-16` floors every limiter ratio.** `min(1, fct_ttf_max/
  (fct_plus·dt/area/hnode + flux_eps))` is always finite (`fct_plus≥0` ⇒ denom `≥ flux_eps`);
  when the antidiff flux vanishes the ratio is large-but-finite and `min` picks the constant 1
  with a 0 cotangent on a *finite* value — no `0·inf`. The `±bignumber=±1e3` padding (a2) is
  finite, so the `max`/`min`/`segment_max`/`segment_min` reductions never see inf. So unlike the
  CG (which needed a separate tight `transpose_solve`), the limiter needs NO special AD
  machinery — the forward `flux_eps` is the whole fix. Plateau `d(SST)/d(k_ver)` = 5.7e-7
  (≈ the upwind 5.9e-7 — the limiter is inactive in the smooth blob, so the subgradient == FD
  there). Decision + rejected alternatives (b smooth-relax, c stop_gradient) documented in
  `docs/LIMITER_GRADIENTS.md`. (`tracer_adv.zalesak_limit`, Task 4.1.)

- **[fct/qr4c] The vertical 4th-order QR4C `Z`-stencil denominators vanish at the bottom-pad
  level (`Zp=concat([Z,Z[-1:]])` ⇒ `Z[nz-1]−Z[nz]=0`) — guard with `where(d==0,1,d)` (the
  recurring masked-divide rule, 4th time).** The masked-out interior formula is unused forward
  but `0·inf=NaN` in the backward pass without the guard. Same class as the eos `bvfreq` and
  `tracer_diff` `1/zdiff` traps. (`tracer_adv._z_stencil`/`adv_flux_ver_ho`, Task 4.1.)

- **[fct/method] Test the limiter where it's ACTIVE — the dump's smooth step-1 leaves it
  inactive.** The real blob is well-resolved ⇒ no overshoots ⇒ the limiter clips nothing ⇒ the
  dump verifies only the HO flux, not the min/max/sign-select limiter logic. Added a synthetic
  **sharp tracer + ×5000 velocity** test vs the numpy FCT reference that forces the limiter to
  bind — the strong check for the limiter branch. (`test_FCT_limiter_active_vs_numpy_reference`,
  Task 4.1.)

- **[fct/diff] Fixing `T_old` also closed the deferred Phase-2 tight multi-step `T/S` gate AND
  dump-verified the blob diffusion.** With FCT + the IC fix, `step()`'s substep-15 `T` matches
  the committed dump to 1.8e-15 (was the "Phase-4 deferred" gate), and the step-2 SSH fields
  (`d_eta`/`hbar`/`eta_n`) — which cascaded the old `T` error through density — now match to
  <1e-11 (was gated loose at 1e-7). The vertical tracer diffusion on a *non-constant* field
  (only ever property-tested in Phase 2) is now confirmed correct by the tight `T` dump match.
  (`test_step_pi.py`, Task 4.1.)

## Phase 4 — opt_visc7 verify + wsplit (Task 4.2)

- **[verify/method] ⚠️ "Ported AND tested" ≠ "every coefficient regime tested" — check the
  branch-selection statistics, not just that the test is green.** The opt_visc=7 flow-aware
  biharmonic was fully ported in Task 2.5, but its flow-aware branch was effectively unverified:
  a diagnostic (run `step()` 10 steps, count edges with `max(γ1·|du|, γ2·|du|²) > γ0`) showed
  **0 flow-aware-active edges at every dump step** — pi's edge-velocity differences grow only
  8e-5→8e-4, all ≪ the |du|>0.03 γ1-onset, so the dump can ONLY ever test the constant-γ0
  biharmonic. The existing `_synthetic` test (uv amp 0.1) *did* reach the γ1 branch (51% of
  edges) but **never** the quadratic γ2 (needs |du|>γ1/γ2=0.351; synthetic max 0.219). Moral:
  when a kernel has data-dependent branches, instrument which branch the test inputs actually
  exercise; a passing test over a too-mild input silently skips a code path. Fix: a strong-flow
  (~2 m/s) synthetic test that binds BOTH branches, with an explicit `assert g2_wins.sum() > 0`.
  (`test_momentum.test_visc_filter_flow_aware_branches_vs_reference`, Task 4.2.)

- **[config] `use_wsplit=0` in the pi/CORE2-d1800 reference config (`fesom_constants.h:56`), so
  `w_e=w, w_i=0` IS the dump-matching path — porting the split is CORE2-readiness, not pi
  correctness.** The vertical-velocity CFL splitter was disabled in the reference runs (it seeded
  a Fortran day-92 barotropic blow-up). Two consequences: (1) the step-1 substep-15 `T` 1.8e-15
  match already *proved* `w_e=w` (tracer advection reads `w_e`); (2) pi's max `cfl_z`~1e-4 ≪
  maxcfl=1.0, so the split would be the identity even if turned on at pi velocities. So
  `compute_wvel_split` is ported faithfully but its active branch is verified only via a
  synthetic super-critical CFL vs the numpy ref — wiring it into `step()` is numerically
  transparent (every gate + the gradient plateau 5.70e-7 unchanged). ⚠️ The implicit part `w_i`
  feeds `impl_vert_visc`'s advective tridiagonal terms, which the Phase-2 kernel drops under the
  `w_i=0` simplification — re-enabling those is a Phase-5 item, gated on `use_wsplit=1`.
  (`ale.compute_wvel_split`, `step.py`, Task 4.2.)

- **[ale/cfl] `cfl_z` is an interface field built from BOTH adjacent layers' `|w|·dt/h` — the
  "above" layer must be ZERO-padded at the surface (not edge-replicated).** The C accumulates
  per layer onto its top (`+=|w[nz]|·dt/h[nz]`) and bottom (`+=|w[nz+1]|·dt/h[nz]`) interfaces,
  so `cfl_z[i] = |w[i]|·dt·(1/h[i] + 1/h[i-1])` with the surface/bottom interfaces getting one
  term. Vectorized: `below = inv_h` (layer i), `above = shift_down_zero(inv_h)` (layer i-1, 0 at
  i=0 since no layer is above the surface). Using the momentum `_shift_down` (edge-replicate)
  here would wrongly double-count the surface layer. The `dt/h` divide is AD-guarded with the
  usual `where(h>0, h, 1)` masked-finite pattern. (`ale.compute_cfl_z`, `fesom_ale.c:204`, Task 4.2.)

- **[verify/method] A rest-trivial element gate becomes a real gate at step ≥2 once the
  trajectory is dump-tight.** The substep-6 `uv_rhs` (viscosity) dump gate was trivial at step 1
  (uv=0 ⇒ the biharmonic adds nothing, substep6==substep5). With FCT making the multi-step
  trajectory tight (Task 4.1), reconstructing substeps 1–6 from the post-step-1 state and
  comparing to the step-2 dump gives a real end-to-end viscosity gate — matched **~1e-17**
  (gather class; the small wind-driven velocities keep it in the constant-γ0 regime, ~1e-9
  viscous contribution). General: deferred "trivial-at-rest" element gates unlock at the first
  nonzero-flow step *after* the trajectory is verified tight against the dump.
  (`test_step_pi.test_step2_uv_rhs_visc_matches_dump`, Task 4.2.)

- **[step/stability] pi 1000 steps (dt=100, full physics) is stable in ~48 s, and the
  vertical CFL stays ≪ maxcfl over the whole window (max `cfl_z`=2.8e-3 ≪ 1.0) — so the
  use_wsplit=0 config is self-consistent long-window, not just at the dump's 10 steps.** The
  jitted `run` amortizes compile so 1000 steps cost ~2.5× the 100-step test, not 10× (~48 s vs
  ~20 s). Over 1000 steps: no NaN, max|uv|=0.17, max|eta|=0.63 m, **S exactly 35** (bit-exact —
  the strongest long-window AB2/threading regression guard), T∈[10.0,14.98]. The AD gate is NOT
  re-run at 1000 steps (the model is mildly chaotic via scatter reassociation — long windows sit
  on the FD chaos floor; `test_gradient.py` stays at N=20 by design). "Climate-close to C" at
  1000 steps stays **indirect** (no C 1000-step pi snapshot — the dump is 10 steps); the tight
  step-1..10 FCT dump match + S-exact + boundedness are the stand-in. (`test_step_pi.py`, Task 4.3.)

## Phase 5 — CORE2 (scoping + pre-port guards)

- **[scope] ⚠️ The C port is a DELIBERATELY SIMPLIFIED FESOM: linfs-only, full-cell, no
  cavities — match THAT, not real-FESOM/Fortran features the parent outline mentions.** The
  parent plan's Phase-5 outline listed "zlevel ALE / local-zstar / partial cells / re-enable
  w_i" — **none exist in the C port** (`fesom_ale.c` is linfs-only; the zlevel algorithm is
  only in the Fortran `oce_ale.F90`; `fesom_mesh.c:617-634` sets `zbar_3d_n[n,nz]=zbar[nz]`
  with no `Z_3d_n`; `use_wsplit=0` + FCT ⇒ `w_i≡0`). FRESH_START §14.7 even says
  `which_ALE='zlevel'` **"but we will use linfs."** Per the golden rule the C port governs:
  **Phase 5 = pi physics (PP/linfs/FCT/opt_visc7) on the CORE2 mesh + PHC IC + JRA55/SSS/runoff.**
  zstar/partial-cells are future and need C-side work first. *Lesson: when the plan outline
  and the C reference disagree, the C reference wins — verify against it before proposing
  scope, don't propagate the outline.* (Caught when a research read showed `fesom_ale.c`
  linfs-only; user flagged the zlevel error directly.)

- **[mesh/orientation] ⚠️ Triangle orientation is the pi↔CORE2 trap — CW is a CHECKED
  load-time invariant now, not an assumption.** The C `orient_cw` (`fesom_mesh.c:430-459`)
  computes `r = bx*cy − by*cx` (cyclic-wrapped) and swaps v2↔v3 whenever `r>0`, forcing
  **every** triangle CW, and runs at `fesom_mesh_read:1193` **before** any geometry is
  derived (`elem_area`@1219, `gradient_sca`@~1230). So both pi and CORE2 export in the same
  CW convention; `elem_area` is `abs` (orientation-free) and `edge_cross_dxdy` is
  centroid-based (orientation-free) — the only orientation-sensitive exported array is
  `gradient_sca` (post-swap ⇒ CW). CORE2's RAW mesh is ~all CCW (~244654/244659 swapped,
  FRESH_START §4); historically a missing swap ⇒ wrong SSH-stiffness sign ⇒ the
  Aleutian-Trench blow-up (§11/§14.8). Added `mesh.check_cw_orientation` + a `load_mesh`
  guard (raises on any `r≥0`) + tests; **pi verified 5839/5839 CW**. This makes a bad CORE2
  export fail loudly at load (Task 5.1) instead of diverging mid-run. (`mesh.py`,
  `test_mesh.py`, this session.)

- **[scope/discipline] ⚠️ Don't invent a "modeling choice" where the rule is "port the C
  exactly."** Phase-5 SSS/runoff was first framed as "match C-literal vs FRESH_START §9's
  shorthand" — a false choice (same error-class as the zlevel slip). The C `fesom_sss_runoff.c`
  mirrors the Fortran sbc and is validated (no SSS problems), so the discipline is a faithful
  1:1 port gated by the dump; §9's `water_flux += (S−Sclim)·v` / `−= runoff` is a *simplified
  description*, not an alternative. (In the no-ice Phase-5 path runoff enters only via the
  global-mean balance — the local term is in ice thermo, off here; the dump gate confirms
  JAX == the C-port-no-ice run.) *Lesson: FRESH_START is a description; the C port is the
  spec. No menu — port it and verify by dump.* (Task 5.5; user flagged.)

- **[mesh/CORE2] The CORE2 mesh port was genuinely ZERO JAX-code — the design held.**
  `load_mesh('data/mesh_core2')` worked unchanged: it reads `nl` from `meta.txt` and the four
  ragged masks already encode per-node variable depth (the only real pi→CORE2 mesh
  difference); full-cell ⇒ global `zbar`/`Z` stays valid so eos/ssh/pp/ale need nothing.
  `test_mesh_core2.py` (12) reuses the pi structural invariants verbatim + pins CORE2 counts
  (nod2D=126858, elem2D=244659, edge2D=371644, nl=48). The export at `npes==1` is cheap
  (job 25386129: 17 s, peak **5.6 GB** — the 32 G request was overkill, 8 G would do; NL is
  read from `aux3d.out`, not compile-time, so the same `build/fesom_port` exports pi and
  CORE2). (Task 5.1.)

- **[mesh/orientation] Empirical confirmation: CORE2 `orient_cw` swapped 244654/244659
  elements to CW** (job log) — exactly FRESH_START §4. So CORE2's raw mesh really is ~all
  CCW and the C normalization is load-bearing; the `check_cw_orientation` guard added to
  `load_mesh` re-verifies it survived export→load (CORE2: all 244659 CW). This is the
  concrete payoff of making CW a checked invariant rather than an assumption. (Task 5.1.)

- **[perf] ⚠️ An EAGER `step()` on CORE2 is ~32 s/step on CPU (~160× pi for ~40× the nodes
  — super-linear, the CG + eager/host-scatter overhead).** So CORE2 rest-state/smoke tests
  use a small step count, and real CORE2 correctness/stability work (Task 5.7) must use the
  **jitted** `run`/`integrate` (amortized compile) and/or GPU — not eager. `build_ssh_operator`
  itself is cheap on CORE2 (0.3 s; host scipy COO for ~1.5M entries). The CORE2 rest-state
  gate (`test_step_core2.py`) confirms `step()` produces no spurious flow on the big mesh
  (max|uv|=1.8e-14, T/S bit-exact) — but note PGF=0 at rest doesn't test the `gradient_sca`
  *sign* (constant field ⇒ Σ∂N=0 regardless); that's exercised by the non-rest dump gate in
  Task 5.7. (Task 5.1.)

- **[env] The fesom-jax env had NO Python NetCDF reader (netCDF4/xarray/h5py all missing);
  the PHC + forcing files are NetCDF-4/HDF5 (scipy.io can't read them).** Installed
  **netCDF4 via the env pip** (user-approved): `…/envs/fesom-jax/bin/python -m pip install
  netCDF4`. numpy (2.4.6) and jax (0.10.1, x64) **unchanged**. ⚠️ A benign
  `RuntimeWarning: numpy.ndarray size changed … Expected 16 … got 96` appears on `import
  netCDF4` (its wheel was built against an older numpy ABI) — harmless, the data path is
  correct (PHC matched the C to ~1e-14). Avoided **numba** (it pins numpy and could break
  jax) by doing the GS extrap in optimized pure Python. (Task 5.2.)

- **[phc/ic] The PHC IC is a faithful numpy port that matches the C to ~1e-14 (MAP class —
  no scatter, so near-bit-exact like the EOS).** `phc_ic.load_phc_ic` mirrors `fesom_phc.c`
  for npes=1/no-cavity: cyclic-pad lon, per-node bilinear bracket (`binarysearch_d` ported
  literally — bracket indices match the C **exactly**), bilinear-horizontal + linear-vertical
  interp onto `mesh.Z`, then `extrap_nod3D` + vertical fill + `ptheta`. The IC is
  **non-differentiable setup** (host numpy, not JAX), cached to `data/ic_core2/{T,S}_ic.npy`;
  `core2_initial_state` injects it via `dataclasses.replace`. (Task 5.2.)

- **[phc/extrap] ⚠️ The land-extrapolation is SEQUENTIAL Gauss-Seidel (order-dependent) and
  must be replicated as such — a Jacobi pass gives different values.** Each dummy ocean node
  is filled ONCE with the mean of neighbours valid *at fill time*; a node filled earlier in a
  sweep (lower index) is visible to later nodes that same sweep (`fesom_phc.c:318-342`). The
  faithful + fast port: per layer, collect dummy nodes in **ascending index order**, sweep
  updating the column **in place**, drop filled nodes, repeat until no progress (no numba
  needed — only the few-thousand coastal dummies are iterated). Post-load surface matched the
  C to ~1e-14 ⇒ the GS order was reproduced exactly. (Task 5.2.)

- **[phc/verify] The C `phc_dump_*` is SURFACE-ONLY — the vertical interp + deep `ptheta`
  are NOT directly gated by it.** `phc_dump_preextrap` (gid,T,S,bilin_i,bilin_j,lon,lat) and
  `phc_dump_postload` (gid,T,S) cover only level 0 (where `ptheta`'s pressure ≈|Z[0]|~2.5 m is
  near-zero). So `test_phc_ic` gates the surface tightly + checks the full field is physical;
  the deep column is verified indirectly by the Task-5.7 per-substep density/EOS gate. Add a
  full-column C dump for a few probes if 5.7 shows a depth mismatch. Also: `T_old`/`S_old`
  (step-1 AB2 history) is provisionally = the PHC field; the exact `valuesold` is finalized in
  5.7 against the dump (cf. the pi `T_old` base-vs-blob lesson). (Task 5.2.)

## Phase 5 — JRA55 forcing reader (Task 5.3)

- **[jra/fidelity] ⚠️⚠️ THE Task-5.3 trap: the C time-interp `field = rdate·coef_a + coef_b`
  CATASTROPHICALLY CANCELS, so a ~1e-13 reassociation in the bilinear gather blows up to ~1e-8
  in the interpolated field — the gather must be BIT-IDENTICAL to the C, not just "1e-13
  close."** `nc_time` is in **Julian days since year 0001** (~2.436e6 for 1958), and
  `coef_b = d1 − coef_a·nc_time[t0]`, so `field = rdate·coef_a + coef_b` subtracts two ~2.4e6
  numbers to get an O(1) result — a ~`coef_a·nc_time·eps` ≈ `164·2.4e6·2.2e-16` ≈ 1e-7 abs
  rounding floor. BOTH C and JAX incur it, but they land on *different* sides unless `d1`/`d2`
  (hence `coef_a`/`coef_b`) are bit-identical. My first gather folded `1/denom` into the weights
  (`Σ wₖsₖ`, `wₖ=dxₖdyₖ/denom`) — algebraically equal to the C's `(Σ sₖ·dxₖ·dyₖ)/denom` but
  ~1e-13 off by reassociation → the interp field came out **~6e-8** off the C (and the error
  *correlated with* `|coef_a|`, max error at the max-`coef_a` node — the smoking gun). Fix:
  compute each corner term as **`(s·dx)·dy` in the C's multiply order**, sum A→D left-to-right,
  **divide the sum by `denom` at the end** (store per-corner `dx,dy` + a per-node `denom`, not a
  folded weight). Result: the 6 scalar fields are **bit-exact (max|diff|=0 over all 126858
  nodes, both dates)**; only the wind carries ~3.5e-15 (the g2r `sin`/`cos`). *Lesson: when a
  downstream formula cancels large numbers, the usual "fold the constant in" optimization is
  WRONG — the division placement is load-bearing; replicate the C's exact op order.*
  (`jra55._build_stencil`/`_gather`, `fesom_jra55.c:480-516`, Task 5.3.)

- **[jra/method] The verification recipe that surfaced it: a step-1 *boundary* dump alone is a
  WEAK gate — add an *interior* dump that exercises genuine time interpolation.** At (day1,sec0)
  `rdate < nc_time[0]` ⇒ the `t_indx` boundary branch sets `coef_a=0`, so `field = d1` (just the
  bilinear gather, no cancellation) — it matched at ~1e-13 even with the folded-weight gather,
  hiding the bug. The (day100, 12:00) interior dump (genuine 2-slice interp + a `getcoeffld`
  cache refresh) is where the cancellation bites and the ~6e-8 error showed. The C dump job
  writes BOTH (`FESOM_JRA_DUMP_DIR` + `FESOM_JRA_DUMP_DAY`/`_SEC`). General: for any
  time/space-interpolated reader, gate at an *interior* point, not just the t=0 boundary where
  the scheme degenerates. (`jobs/jax_jra_dump_core2.sh`, `dump_jra_fields` in `fesom_main.c`,
  Task 5.3.)

- **[jra/traps] Three literal-parity traps the port had to honor (all dump-confirmed).**
  (1) **Field order is uas,vas,huss,rsds,rlds,tas,prra,prsn** — `tas` (air temp) is the **6th**
  field, NOT 3rd (`fesom_jra55.h:50`); a naïve alphabetical/physical ordering silently swaps
  T_air with humidity. (2) **Interp on GEOGRAPHIC coords, rotate the wind AFTER** — the bilinear
  bracket uses `geo_coord_nod2D/RAD` (deg, only a `<0`→`+360` wrap, no `>360` wrap unlike PHC),
  but the (uas,vas) result is then `fesom_vector_g2r`-rotated into the **model** frame (Euler
  50/15/−90); scalars are NOT rotated. (3) **Per-field mid-interval time shift** (`nm_nc_tmid=0`):
  instantaneous fields (uas/tas) are sampled on the 3-h marks, flux fields (prra) on the
  half-marks, and the shift `nc_time[i]=½(t[i+1]+t[i])` gives each field its **own** `nc_time`,
  so `getcoeffld` is per-field (not shared) even though the *spatial* stencil is shared (all 8
  files share one 640×320 grid → build the gather once). (`jra55.py`, `fesom_jra55.c`, Task 5.3.)

- **[jra/config] `flip_lat = 0` for JRA55-do v1.4.0** — `lat` is stored **ascending**
  (−89.57→89.57), so the C's north→south flip (`fesom_jra55.c:270`) is inert here. The reader
  implements it faithfully anyway (per-field, applied to both `nc_lat` and each data slice) so a
  future N→S-stored field still works; just don't expect the flip path to be exercised by the
  CORE2 gate. `Nlon=640+2=642` (cyclic halo), `Nlat=320`, `Ntime=2920` (3-hourly), cal=gregorian.
  (Task 5.3.)

- **[jra/scope] The reader is host-numpy, non-differentiable SETUP (like `phc_ic`) — the
  differentiable SST→flux / current→stress seam is the bulk (Task 5.4), not here.** Output is 8
  per-node physics-unit arrays (`u_wind`/`v_wind` rotated, `Tair` °C, `prec_*` m/s) that become
  per-step *device constants*. A simple per-field `getcoeffld` cache (refresh only when `rdate`
  leaves `[nc_time[t_indx], nc_time[t_indx_p1]]`, `fesom_jra55_step:651`) avoids re-reading the
  640×320 slices every step; the cache is a pure optimization (no effect on the result — the
  coefficients depend only on `rdate`'s bracket, not on call history, so a fresh reader == a
  sequentially-advanced one). netCDF4 reads use `set_auto_maskandscale(False)` to get the raw
  float32 the C's `nc_get_vara_float` sees (JRA has no scale/offset; bit-exact promotion to f64).
  (`jra55.JRA55Reader`, Task 5.3.)

## Phase 5 — L&Y09 open-water bulk formulae (Task 5.4)

- **[bulk/AD] ⚠️⚠️ "Drop the early break, run a fixed N, the result is IDENTICAL" was WRONG —
  it is a small but real, bounded divergence, and the sub-plan's "post-convergence iters are
  no-ops" claim is corrected.** The L&Y09 Monin-Obukhov coefficient loop (`ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode`,
  `fesom_bulk.c:89-172`) does **not** robustly converge at near-calm nodes: the C production
  breaks on `|Δcd|/(cd+1e-8)<1e-4`, but that "convergence" is a transient slowdown, so continuing
  to a fixed 5 iters lands elsewhere. Measured on CORE2 (year 1958): **`ch` differs by up to ~88%**
  fixed-5-vs-early-break at the calmest tropical nodes (`cd`/`ce` up to ~4.5%). The saving grace is
  it's **physically bounded**: `ch`/`ce` only enter the `ug`-scaled sensible/latent terms, so the
  heat_flux impact is **≤7.2 W/m² at ~4 nodes** (mean ~2e-4; <0.1 W/m² for 126848/126858 nodes),
  stress ≤~4e-3 N/m². *Decision: JAX runs fixed-5 (the AD-safe analog of the C's ≤5-iter cap — a
  data-dependent `while`-break is not reverse-mode differentiable), and is verified against a
  **fixed-5** C dump, not the early-break production. The residual vs production is this bounded,
  documented effect.* *Lesson: never assume "iterate-to-fixed-point" tolerates extra iterations —
  a capped non-convergent solver (M-O, sea-ice EVP, some EOS inversions) gives genuinely different
  answers per iteration count; measure the divergence, bound its PHYSICAL impact (not the raw
  coefficient %), and make the reference match your iteration scheme.* (`forcing.ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode`,
  `test_forcing.test_earlybreak_drop_is_physically_bounded`, Task 5.4.)

- **[bulk/method] The fix: a `fixed_iters` env-gated C dump so JAX-fixed-5 is compared to
  C-fixed-5 (apples-to-apples), separately bounding fixed-5-vs-production.** Added an
  `int fixed_iters` param to the C `ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode` (skips the break) + a `fesom_bulk_dump`
  (gated `FESOM_BULK_DUMP_DIR`) that runs fixed-5 and dumps `cd/ce/ch + heat_flux/water_flux/
  stress_node + elem stress`, **plus** the early-break `cd_eb/ce_eb/ch_eb` columns and the exact
  `T_oc` (so the JAX forward gate is fed the C's own SST and isolates the bulk from the ~1e-14
  PHC-IC residual). Result: **JAX-fixed-5 == C-fixed-5 to ~1e-17 (cd/ce/ch), ~6e-13 (heat_flux),
  ~5e-16 (stress)** over all 126858 nodes — essentially bit-exact (MAP-class, like the EOS). For
  Task 5.7 the matched per-substep reference must set `FESOM_BULK_FIXED_ITERS=1` or the calm-node
  coefficients won't match. (`fesom_bulk_dump`, `jax_bulk_dump_core2.sh`, Task 5.4.)

- **[bulk/AD] The AD-safe rewrite of `x2 = sqrt(|1−16ζ|); if(x2<1) x2=1` is
  `sqrt(max(|1−16ζ|,1))` — bit-identical to the C AND smooth through the ζ=1/16 singularity.**
  The naïve port hits `sqrt(0)` at ζ=1/16 (inf derivative ⇒ `0·inf` NaN backward even though the
  forward floors x2 to 1). Folding the floor INSIDE the sqrt argument (`max(arg,1)`) means: for
  arg≥1 it's `sqrt(arg)` (==C, and arg≥1 ⇒ ζ away from 1/16 ⇒ the abs is smooth there); for arg<1
  it's the constant `sqrt(1)=1` (==C's floor, gradient 0). One expression kills the kink, the abs
  kink, AND matches the C exactly — cleaner than a double-`where` safe-sqrt. The relative-wind `u`
  and stress `mag` still need the double-`where` safe-sqrt (their `sqrt(Δu²)` arg vanishes when
  wind==current, and that lane IS on the `current→stress` gradient path). The `copysign` step
  selectors (cd_n10 hi/lo-wind switch, the stab switch) are ported **literally** via `jnp.copysign`
  (gradient 0, exact at ±0) — not `where(>0)`, which mishandles `−0.0`. (`forcing._psi`/`_safe_speed`/
  `_cd_n10`, `fesom_bulk.c:99-160`, Task 5.4.)

- **[bulk/fidelity] The deliberate Fortran wind mismatch is load-bearing and was preserved.**
  The exchange coefficients (`ncar_ocean_fluxes_mode`) and the wind stress use the **relative**
  wind `|u_atm − u_ocn|` (floored at 0.3); but `obudget`'s `ug` (the sensible/latent multiplier)
  uses the **absolute** wind `|u_atm|` (`fesom_bulk.c:283`, mirroring `ice_thermo_oce.F90`). A
  synthetic-current dump mode (`current_mode=1`, an 8-entry exact-decimal table indexed by
  `(gid−1)%8`, reproduced bit-for-bit in JAX) exercises this: it moves the coefficients/stress via
  the relative wind while `ug` stays absolute, and validates the `current→stress` feedback that the
  zero-current IC state can't (uvnode=0 at setup). Also: `albw=0.1` (CORE2 `namelist.ice`, NOT the
  LY2004 0.066), bulk gravity `9.80` (NOT config.G=9.81), and `heat_flux = qns − qsr` is the
  bulk_compute output **before** shortwave-penetration removal (a Task-5.6 step; `USE_SW_PENE=1` in
  the C). (`forcing.bulk_surface_fluxes`/`obudget`, Task 5.4.)

- **[workflow] Cheap C dump jobs schedule far faster on `-p compute --time≤30:00` (debug QOS)
  than on `-p shared`.** The bulk dump sat minutes pending on `shared` (Priority); resubmitted to
  `compute` with a 30-min walltime it started in ~16 s (DKRZ Levante's short-walltime compute jobs
  land in the fast debug/devel QOS). Use `-p compute --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --time=00:30:00 -A ab0995`
  (drop `--mem` — compute nodes are exclusive) for the 17–25 s mesh/IC/dump jobs. (User-flagged;
  `jax_bulk_dump_core2.sh`, Task 5.4.) [[fesom-jax-port]]

- **[workflow] Large generated artifacts go on `/work`, not `/home`** (user standing rule).
  `port_jax/data/` (499 M: mesh export, IC, C dumps) was moved to
  `/work/ab0995/a270088/port_jax/data` with a `data → /work/...` **symlink** at the repo root, so
  all relative-path code (`Path(__file__).parents[2]/"data"`) and the C job scripts (which write to
  `/home/.../data/...`) transparently land on `/work`. `.gitignore` needs **both** `/data` (the
  symlink) and `/data/` (a plain dir) — the trailing-slash form alone does not ignore a symlink.
  (User-flagged, Task 5.4.)

## Phase 5 — SSS restoring + CORE2 runoff (Task 5.5)

- **[sss/fill] ⚠️ The 30-cell missing-value fill is JACOBI (reads the ORIGINAL field), NOT
  sequential Gauss-Seidel like PHC's `extrap_nod3D` — so it VECTORIZES.** The C copies
  `ncdata → ncdata_temp` first, and every missing cell reads its neighbours from
  `ncdata_temp` (never modified during the fill loop), so fills do **not** cascade ⇒
  order-independent. A `scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter` box-mean (expand `k=1..30`, fill each
  cell at the SMALLEST k whose `(2k+1)²` window — clamped at the grid edge with
  `mode='constant',cval=0`, NOT cyclic — holds ≥1 valid cell) reproduces it. The `/count`
  crushes the box-sum reassociation: **105148/126858 SSS nodes bit-exact, ~35 coastal
  fill-bracket nodes ~1e-12** (the window straddles a land-extrapolated cell). Contrast PHC's
  extrap which *is* sequential GS and had to be replicated in index order (Task 5.2). *Lesson:
  read whether a fill reads from a frozen copy (Jacobi → vectorize) or in-place (GS → replicate
  order) before porting it.* (`sss_runoff._fill_missing_expand`, `fesom_sss_runoff.c:207-239`.)

- **[sss/interp] `interp_2d_field` is a THIRD distinct bilinear routine — lat CLAMPS, lon
  CYCLIC-WRAPS — not the JRA `extrp`-flag stencil nor PHC's ±halo padding.** Out-of-range
  latitude pins to the boundary grid value (clamp `y`, weight 1 on the edge node); out-of-range
  longitude wraps across the 0/360 seam with gap `lon[0]+(360−lon[last])` (here 1.0° between
  359.5 and 0.5). Ported as `clip(y)+searchsorted` (lat) + a 3-branch in-range/below/above
  select (lon); the corner blend keeps the C's `(s·rt_lon1+s·rt_lon2)·rt_lat` order. **Runoff
  bit-exact, SSS bit-exact at the 105k ocean-bracket nodes** ⇒ the bracket+blend is exact for
  any node not touching a filled cell. Each forcing reader has its own interpolation routine —
  do not assume one stencil fits all. (`sss_runoff._interp_2d_field`, `fesom_sss_runoff.c:34-113`.)

- **[sss/fidelity] The salt/water balance matched the C to ~1e-20 — the global-mean's
  ÷`ocean_area` crushes the reduction back to MAP-class (the hbar/w ÷area lesson again).**
  `virtual_salt = S_top·water_flux − ⟨·⟩`, `⟨x⟩ = Σ(x·areasvol_surf)/ocean_area`. Fed the C's
  own `S_top`/`water_flux`, the multiply is bit-exact; the only JAX↔C difference is the
  area-weighted global mean. The integral `Σ(x·area)` ~1e9 (x~1e-6, area~3e9, ×1.3e5 nodes) so
  the ~1e-7 sum reassociation, ÷`ocean_area`=3.6e14, lands at **~1e-21**. So a reduction
  divided by a huge constant area gates TIGHT (~1e-20), not at the loose 1e-12 reduction floor —
  measure at the output. The flux math is fed the dump's own inputs (apples-to-apples, like the
  bulk's `T_oc`), isolating it from the reader. (`sss_runoff.sss_runoff_fluxes`,
  `test_sss_runoff.py`, `fesom_sss_runoff.c:382-440`.)

- **[sss/config] ⚠️ `ref_sss_local=1` (rsss = LOCAL S_top, not 34.7) + NO legacy month +1 —
  both are C-comment-documented traps; port them, don't reinvent.** The CORE2 namelist sets
  `ref_sss_local=.true.`, so the virtual-salt reference salinity is the per-node surface
  salinity, NOT the constant `ref_sss=34.7` (using 34.7 over-strengthens the flux where SSS is
  low → Arctic freshwater bias — `fesom_sss_runoff.c:298-307`). And the monthly SSS read fires
  on the FIRST step of the new month (where `month_now` is already M+1), so there is **no `+1`**
  (the legacy Fortran fired on the LAST step of month M and added +1; keeping it would skip a
  month — `:351-359`). `surf_relax_S = 10/(60·3600·24) = 1.929e-6 s⁻¹`. (Task 5.5.)

- **[sss/method] The month-CROSSING dump (m4 = Apr/day100) is the real gate; m1 (Jan/day1)
  alone is the trivial first-month case.** Same shape as the JRA interior-vs-boundary lesson:
  m1 just reads SALT month 1 at the first step. The m4 dump steps jra to day100 (April),
  **recomputes the bulk** `water_flux`, and reads SALT **month 4** — exercising a different SSS
  slice + a different (April) bulk input, confirming the reader picks the right month and the
  flux math handles the seasonal target. The C `fesom_sss_runoff_dump` saves+restores
  `water_flux` (the one field the step both reads and writes in place) so two month dumps in one
  run stay independent. (`jax_sss_dump_core2.sh`, `fesom_main.c` SSS-dump block, Task 5.5.)

## Phase 5 — wire surface BCs + assemble CORE2 forcing (Task 5.6)

- **[ice/scope] ⚠️⚠️ The C "no ice" run is NOT ice-free — it keeps a STATIC `a_ice` mask
  that gates the surface fluxes.** `fesom_ice_initial_state` (`fesom_ice.c`, called
  `fesom_main.c:792`) sets `a_ice = 0.9` wherever **(non-cavity & the PHC IC SST < 0)** — and
  with `FESOM_NO_ICE_DYN/ADV/THERMO=1` the ice model never runs, so that mask is *frozen* for
  the whole run (37089/126858 nodes on CORE2). It has **two** couplings in the no-ice path:
  (1) **shortwave penetration is skipped where `a_ice>0`** (`fesom_bulk.c:381-382` —
  `cal_shortwave_rad`); (2) **the wind stress is blended** `stress = ice_drag·a_ice +
  atm·(1−a_ice)` with `ice_drag = ρ·Cd·|u_ice−u_w|·(u_ice−u_w)`, `u_ice=0` (static),
  `u_w = uvnode[:,0]`, `ρ·Cd = FESOM_DENSITY_0·cd_oce_ice = 1030·5.5e-3` (`fesom_ice_coupling.c:
  234-264`, `oce_fluxes_mom`). The **bulk itself does NOT gate on `a_ice`** (open-water fluxes
  everywhere — verified: at an ice node the C heat_flux == the JAX open-water bulk). `ocean2ice`
  runs even with ice off (so `u_w` updates each step → a step≥2 current→stress drag), but
  thermo/`oce_fluxes` are skipped (so heat/water/salt are the bulk+sss values). **User decision
  (2026-06-06): match the C — replicate the static mask** (not truly-ice-free). Symptom that
  found it: JAX (assuming `a_ice=0`) mismatched the C heat_flux by **122 W/m²** at an Antarctic
  node (the visible band `0.486·shortwave` it wrongly added under ice). *Lesson: "ice off" in a
  coupled model rarely means `a_ice≡0` — grep every `a_ice` reader before assuming ice-free.*
  (`core2_forcing.ice_ic_aice`/`compute_surface_fluxes`, Task 5.6.)

- **[tracers/T_old] ⚠️ The CORE2 step-1 `T_old`/`S_old` (AB2 `valuesold`) is the CONSTANT
  BASE 10/35, NOT the PHC field — the exact analog of the pi blob `T_old` trap.** The C order
  (`fesom_main.c`): set `values = const 10/35` (`:413`) → run the rest-sanity `advect_one`
  which saves `valuesold = values = 10/35` (`:724-756`, via `init_tracers_AB_one`) → **then**
  `fesom_phc_load_ic` overwrites `values = PHC` but leaves `valuesold` (`:778`). So at step 1
  `ttfAB = −(0.5+ε)·base + (1.5+ε)·PHC`, not `PHC`. `core2_initial_state` had `T_old=T=PHC` →
  corrupted the step-1 FCT advection: post-step `T` was off **2.4e-3** (a *large fraction of the
  one-step tendency*, surface-concentrated with an opposite-sign dipole at level 1). Fix:
  `T_old = masked base 10`, `S_old = masked base 35`. *Lesson (3rd time, pi+CORE2): at step 1
  `T_old ≠ T`; the IC's `valuesold` is whatever the last pre-IC-overwrite `advect_one` saved.*
  (`phc_ic.core2_initial_state`, Task 5.6.)

- **[bulk/fixed-iters] ⚠️ `FESOM_BULK_FIXED_ITERS=1` was honored ONLY by `fesom_bulk_dump`,
  NOT by the time-loop `fesom_bulk_compute` (hardcoded `fixed_iters=0` = early-break).** So the
  per-substep dump captured the *production early-break* bulk while JAX runs the AD-safe fixed-5
  loop → at the non-convergent calm/cold nodes (Task 5.4) the heat_flux diverged **1.6e-4 W/m²**
  (2.5e-7 rel on a 633 W/m² flux at an extreme-stability Arctic node). NOT an input difference:
  the PHC SST matched 3.5e-15 and a 1e-13 wind perturbation only moved heat_flux 6e-12 (×60).
  Fix: env-gate `fesom_bulk_compute` on `FESOM_BULK_FIXED_ITERS` too (`fesom_bulk.c:250-263,283`).
  After it, heat_flux → **1.1e-13**. *Lesson: when a fidelity flag exists, grep that EVERY code
  path which feeds the gate honors it — a dump-only flag silently leaves the real kernel on the
  production branch.* (`fesom_bulk.c`, Task 5.6.)

- **[forcing/method] The step-1 integrated `T`/`S` dump match is the COMPREHENSIVE CORE2 gate
  — bit-exact (~7e-15) once all three bugs above are fixed.** Post-step `T`/`S` is the end of
  the step and depends on every upstream kernel (EOS/PGF/PP/momentum/CG-SSH/ALE/FCT/vert-diff)
  AND the new surface BCs, so a tight match validates the whole assembled step in one number —
  no need for per-substep dynamics gates at 5.6 (those, with calibrated tolerances, are 5.7).
  Verified bit-exact: density 2.3e-13, bvfreq 1e-16, Kv 0.0, uv ~1e-10, d_eta ~2e-9 (CORE2 CG
  takes 43 iters vs pi's 3 → more reassociation), `w` 4e-12, **post-step T 7.1e-15 / S 2.1e-14**;
  multi-step T/S stay ~1e-9 over steps 2-3 (the loop-carried jra date + AB2 + step≥2 ice drag
  thread correctly). (`test_core2_step.py`, Task 5.6.)

- **[runoff/scope] ⚠️ Runoff is INERT in the Phase-5 no-ice config — by the C's DESIGN, not a
  bug. It works fully in the ice-on run.** The C routes runoff through **sea-ice thermo**, not
  the standalone sbc (`fesom_sss_runoff.c:376-380` "Phase C3b: removed runoff subtraction;
  runoff is now folded into `ice->flx_fw` inside `fesom_therm_ice`; subtracting again would
  double-count"). Ice-ON path: `runoff → fesom_ice_thermo.c:318 prec=rain+runo+snow(1−A) →
  :509 flx_fw → fesom_ice_coupling.c:139 water_flux=−flx_fw → :391 virtual_salt=rsss·water_flux
  → bc_S` (river-mouth freshening that advects — what makes runoff "work"). With
  `FESOM_NO_ICE_THERMO=1` (Phase 5) that block is gated off, so `water_flux` stays the **bulk
  evap−prec** (no runoff), `virtual_salt = rsss·(evap−prec)`, and the balance
  `water_flux += ⟨water_flux+runoff⟩` is inert in linfs (the only `water_flux` consumers are the
  **non-linfs** `ssh_rhs`/ALE paths, `fesom_ssh.c:322-324`). ⇒ runoff has zero effect on the
  Phase-5 trajectory (a known salty coastal/Arctic bias). **The port is faithful** (dump:
  `virtual_salt` ~1e-20). *Lesson: trace where a forcing's LOCAL term actually lives before
  declaring it "works/doesn't work" — runoff's local door is ice thermo, so "ice off" silently
  removes it.* (User-flagged; user decision = keep matching the no-ice C run, with the Phase-6
  activation plan locked.) (Task 5.6.)

- **[runoff/phase6] Runoff "comes online" for free once Phase 6 ports the ice freshwater
  budget — the reader + balance are done and the seam is pure.** No Phase-5 runoff code needs
  revisiting: `sss_runoff.runoff_node` (reader, bit-exact) + `sss_runoff_fluxes(water_flux, …,
  runoff_node, …)` (the balance, **pure in `water_flux`**) are already in place. Phase 6 only
  adds (a) `fesom_ice_thermodynamics` folding runoff into `flx_fw`, (b) `fesom_ice_oce_fluxes`
  setting `water_flux=−flx_fw`; then `core2_forcing.compute_surface_fluxes`'s ice-on branch
  feeds `−flx_fw` (incl. runoff) into the EXISTING `sss_runoff_fluxes` instead of the bulk's
  `evap−prec`. Verify ice-on with the dump recipe at river-mouth nodes; no double-count if the
  C3b design is followed (runoff in `flx_fw`, sbc local-term stays removed). Full spec:
  sub-plan "Runoff handoff to Phase 6". (Task 5.6.)

- **[ad/forcing] The surface forcing adds three differentiable seams into the tracer/momentum
  eqns, all AD-safe by construction.** `bc_T = −dt·heat_flux/vcpw` (SST→heat_flux via the bulk),
  `bc_S = dt·(virtual_salt+relax_salt)` (SST→water_flux→virtual_salt + S_top→relax_salt), and
  the ice-ocean drag `current→stress` (safe-sqrt for `|u_w|` at `u_w=0`). `sw_3d` is a per-step
  forcing **constant** (depends only on JRA shortwave + chl climatology + geometry, not state),
  so it carries no AD path — only its additive `swsurf_W` on `heat_flux` matters, and that's a
  constant offset (preserves `d(heat_flux)/d(SST)`). `cal_shortwave_rad`'s data-dependent break
  (aux<1e-5) vectorizes as a cumulative-OR mask (no monotonicity assumption). The chl reader is
  the SAME `read_other_NetCDF` routine as SSS (Sweeney = the C default; constant chl=0.1 is the
  `FESOM_CHL_SOURCE=None` seam). (`tracer_diff.py`/`forcing.cal_shortwave_rad`, Task 5.6.)

## Phase 5 — matched C dump run + CORE2 stability (Task 5.7)

- **[stability/scope] ⚠️⚠️ "No ice" is numerically stable for ~1 week, then the UNBOUNDED
  high-lat SUPERCOOLING destabilizes the dynamics — a PHYSICAL limitation (the C supercools +
  tracks JAX identically through the verified ~day 2.3 window), not a numerical bug.** The
  Phase-5 no-ice CORE2 run (PHC IC + JRA55 + SSS/runoff, dt=500)
  is numerically clean for **days 1–7** (no NaN; max|vel| ≤ ~1.9 m/s < 3; |SSH| ≤ ~2.8 m < 5;
  the Aleutian-Trench node 94122 stays warm ~3.2 °C and calm). But with no sea ice to cap
  high-latitude heat loss, SST **supercools monotonically without bound**: −1.9 (IC) → −5.8
  (day 1) → −16.5 (day 5) → −22.8 (day 8). Once SST drops below ~−20 °C the JM-EOS is being
  evaluated far outside its valid range, the spurious density field drives spurious convection,
  and at **model day ~8.1 (step 1399) max|vel| finally crosses 3 m/s**. This is the *anticipated*
  no-ice failure mode (sub-plan risk #1 / FRESH_START §15 "SST < −2 without ice"), NOT a port
  error. **The matched C arbiter supercools + tracks JAX identically through the verified window
  (~day 2.3 / step 396; see next lesson — the longer C run was cancelled, so the day-8 figures
  are JAX's, shared by the mechanism)** ⇒ the C does NOT numerically blow up at this config
  either, so the Task-5.7 "if the C itself blows up, ice must move to Phase 5" finding did
  **not** trigger — ice stays Phase 6, and a physically realistic SST simply needs
  the ice cap. *Lesson: distinguish numerical stability (bounded vel/SSH/CG, no NaN) from
  thermodynamic realism (SST in range); a no-ice ocean is the former for ~a week and never the
  latter at high latitudes.* (`scripts/core2_stability_run.py`, Task 5.7.)

- **[stability/method] The matched C arbiter run is the decisive truth-teller: JAX tracks the C
  to 3 sig figs on the bulk min/max diagnostics, even though individual elements diverge
  chaotically.** Running the C at the IDENTICAL config (`FESOM_MIX_SCHEME=PP FESOM_NO_GMREDI=1
  FESOM_NO_ICE_*=1 FESOM_BULK_FIXED_ITERS=1`, dt=500) with the per-step monitor
  (`FESOM_PRINT_EVERY`) gives a step-by-step reference for SST-range / max|uv| / max|eta|.
  JAX vs C at step 216 (1.25 d): **SST_min −6.60 = −6.60, max|uv| 1.389 ≈ 1.39, max|eta| 2.715 ≈
  2.71** — agreement to ~3 sig figs, *despite* the per-element chaotic divergence (the step-1
  bit-exact match degrades to ~1e-6 by step 3). The reason: **min/max reductions are robust
  observables of the forced large-scale response** (the supercooling, the geostrophic
  adjustment), which both models share, while the FP/CG-iteration chaos lives in the small-scale
  detail that the reductions don't see. *Lesson: to cross-validate a chaotic multi-step
  trajectory you cannot bit-compare, gate on robust global reductions (range, max-speed) against
  the matched reference — they track far longer than any pointwise field.* (`jobs/jax_core2_stability.sh`,
  `core2_stability_run.py`, Task 5.7.)

- **[dynamics/calibration] Step-1 per-substep DYNAMICS are bit-exact-class (~1e-15); the spread
  blows to ~1e-6 by step 3 — and the 5.6 "uv~1e-10/d_eta~2e-9" was the steps-2/3 evolution, not
  step 1.** Because JAX and C start from the IDENTICAL PHC IC (incl. the `T_old`=base trap), every
  step-1 substep input matches and the only spread is FP reassociation: measured at the 7 probes,
  pgf/Av/hnode ~0..1e-17, uv_rhs/uv/d_eta/eta_n/hbar/w ~1e-16..8e-15 (all bit-exact-class). From
  step 2 the **discrete CG iteration count** (CORE2 takes 32–43 iters; a ±1-iteration difference
  near the residual tolerance makes the solutions jump apart) + the FCT limiter amplify the
  ~1e-15 to ~2.6e-8 (d_eta) / ~2.8e-7 (uv) at step 2, ~1e-7 / ~2e-6 at step 3 — bounded, not
  growing catastrophically. Two large-magnitude intermediates need scaled tolerances: `ssh_rhs`
  (~1e5, transport-divergence ×area/dt) and `pressure` (~5e5, hydrostatic integral) match to
  ~1e-11 *relative* (4.9e-7 / 2.2e-10 absolute). *Lesson: a per-substep gate is only "tight" at
  step 1 where inputs are shared; downstream of a chaotic solver, calibrate to the accumulated
  spread, and use relative tolerances for the big intermediate fields.*
  (`tests/test_core2_step.py::test_step1_dynamics_per_substep`, Task 5.7.)

- **[dump/layout] The C dump pairs each NODE probe with its incident ELEMENT gid — element
  fields land at element gids, node fields at node gids.** `fesom_dump.c` records, per probe,
  the node fields (T/S/density/Kv/pressure/d_eta/eta_n/hbar/ssh_rhs/w/hnode) at the node gid AND
  the element fields (pgf_x/y, Av, uv_rhs_u/v, uv_u/v) at `s_elem_gid` (an incident triangle's
  global id). On the CORE2 dump the 7 node probes `{1001,33778,43828,61202,66921,79663,94122}`
  came with 7 element probes `{307,747,25954,61526,99096,110065,154575}` (one >nod2D, the
  give-away that they are element ids). So the dynamics gate compares `uv[gid−1,:,comp]` at the
  ELEM probes, not the node probes — getting this wrong silently compares the wrong cells.
  (`tests/test_core2_step.py::_emaxabs`, Task 5.7.)

- **[perf] Jitted CORE2 step: GPU ~0.06 s, CPU ~3 s, eager ~32 s.** The jitted `step_jit` is
  ~10× faster than eager on CPU and **~500×** on an A100 — a 10-model-day run (1728 steps) is a
  ~2-minute GPU job (incl. ~48 s mesh+IC+forcing host build + a one-time compile of the two AB2
  step variants). Per-step host-sync of a handful of scalar diagnostics (NaN / SST-range /
  max|vel| / max|eta| / Aleutian node) is cheap enough to monitor every step and pinpoint the
  exact destabilization step. The single-rank C reference is much slower (~4.6 s/step) — it is
  an MPI code run on 1 rank — so for the C arbiter cap the run or give it a non-debug QOS.
  (`scripts/core2_stability_gpu.sh`, Task 5.7.)

## Phase 5 — CORE2-slice gradient gate (Task 5.8, GATE 5)

- **[ad/scope] ⚠️⚠️ The multi-step FORCED CORE2 trajectory is genuinely NON-SMOOTH in the
  physics parameters — a clean FD↔AD plateau is only well-posed in SMOOTH regimes, NOT over
  the full forced model.** pi's clean `d(mean SST)/d(k_ver)` plateau (5.70e-7) works because
  the smooth Gaussian blob keeps the FCT Zalesak limiter AND the convective adjustment
  (`max(N²,0)` / instabmix) **dormant**. Under real CORE2 forcing (PHC fronts +
  supercooling-driven convection) those kinks are **active**, so the loss is genuinely
  non-smooth in `k_ver` at the FD scale: the N=20 `d(mean SST)/d(k_ver)` FD does **not**
  plateau (AD=+33.5; FD swings −15.1 → +6.4 → +222 → +37 across h=1e-2…1e-6; min rel 9.7e-2).
  The AD is a valid **(sub)gradient** (the smallest-h FD ≈ +37 is the closest); FD *across* a
  kink ≠ the slope. So the quantitative FD↔AD gate runs where the assembled model **is**
  smooth: **N=1** `d(mean SST)/d(k_ver)` (plateau **7.5e-10**) — at step 1 `uv=0` ⇒ the PP
  shear term vanishes ⇒ `Kv = k_ver` *additively* on stable columns (the convective mask is
  fixed by the IC density, so `k_ver` can't move it) — plus the isolated bulk seams + the
  linear-solve residual. The multi-step CG/FCT/EOS machinery is pi-proven (identical code) and
  AD-safe on CORE2 (the masked-NaN probe). *Lesson: re-validating a gradient by FD needs a
  smooth regime; a forced realistic trajectory exercises kinks (flux limiters, convective
  adjustment) that a synthetic smooth IC hides — match the FD regime to what is smooth, and
  lean on the (sub)gradient + masked-NaN finiteness for the non-smooth full model. This is the
  long-anticipated "model is mildly chaotic ⇒ test_gradient stays short/smooth" lesson, now
  shown to be STRONG (not mild) under real forcing.* (`scripts/core2_grad_gate.py` [1]/[4],
  job 25394380, Task 5.8.)

- **[ad/observable] ⚠️ To FD-probe a sub-path's gradient the observable must actually DEPEND
  on the parameter — the barotropic SSH `d_eta` is PHYSICALLY INSENSITIVE to `a_ver`
  (`d(Σd_eta²)/d(a_ver) ≈ −7e-17`, correctly ~0, AD agrees — not a bug).** `d_eta` solves the
  *depth-integrated* transport divergence (set by the wind stress + bathymetry); `a_ver` only
  redistributes momentum **vertically**, conserving the column integral, so `d_eta ⊥ a_ver`.
  And `k_ver` doesn't reach the CG in one step (it enters the *final* vertical diffusion,
  downstream of the solve). So no obvious single-step param-gradient probes the CG transpose on
  CORE2. Verify the CG implicit-diff **directly by the residual**: for `f(b)=½‖S⁻¹b‖²`,
  `∇f = S⁻¹·d_eta`, so the AD cotangent must SOLVE `S·g_ad = d_eta` — `‖S·g_ad − d_eta‖/‖d_eta‖
  = 8.8e-14` confirms the tight transpose reached the true `S⁻¹` on the 40×-bigger CORE2 matrix.
  A residual check is **strictly stronger** than matching another run of the same `_pcg` (a
  non-converging / wrong-preconditioner solver passes *that*). *Lesson: choose a parameter the
  observable depends on; verify a linear solver's implicit-diff by the residual `S·g − cotangent`,
  not a parameter sweep.* (`test_gradient_core2.test_grad_cg_transpose_core2`, Task 5.8.)

- **[ad/bulk-seam] The NEW Phase-5 differentiable forcing seams are AD-correct to ~1e-11
  (FD↔AD), well-conditioned because the bulk is a per-node pure map.** `d(Σheat_flux)/d(SST)`
  plateau **5.3e-11** (physical sign **+**: warmer ocean ⇒ more heat loss ⇒ larger upward
  `heat_flux`), `d(Σstress)/d(u_current)` **3.6e-12**. Sum the directional derivative over a
  SMOOTH node subset (`|SST−Tair|>1`, `1<|Δu|<30`): the bulk has kinks at SST=Tair (the initial
  `stab` switch), **ζ_u≈0** (the in-loop neutral `stab` switch + the `ψ` branch flip), u10=33
  (drag switch) and Δu=0 (the safe-sqrt); nodes straddling a kink corrupt the large-h FD
  (rel ~4e-3 at h=1e-2), but the straddler count scales with h, so the **min-over-h plateau**
  lands kink-free at h≈1e-6. *Lesson: for a kinky per-node map, take the directional FD over a
  smooth node subset and sweep h — the plateau lives at the small-h end where the straddlers
  vanish.* (`test_forcing.test_ad_vs_fd_heat_flux_sst` / `_stress_current`, Task 5.8.)

- **[ad/memory] The checkpointed N=20 CORE2 backward peaks at 37.8 GB on an A100 — fits the
  80 GB card (59%); on a 40 GB card it's at the limit (drop to ~N=10 or use O(√N) nesting).**
  (pi N=200 was 4.23 GB; CORE2 ≈ 40× nodes × 1/10 the steps ⇒ ~9× ⇒ ~38 GB, consistent.) The
  masked-NaN probe `d(mean SST)/d(T₀)` at N=20 is finite everywhere, **exactly 0** on the
  below-bottom masked lanes and nonzero (5.5e-3) on wet — the strong AD-safety gate now on the
  *assembled CORE2 model* (the new bulk seams + the eos/tracer_diff/FCT masked-divide guards in
  one backward). ⚠️ A login/CPU node could **not** hold even the N=4 T₀ backward (the process
  was killed) → this is a GPU-only gate; the CPU suite runs the N=1 masked-NaN probe.

# Phase 6 — Sea Ice (sub-plan `docs/plans/20260606-fesom-jax-phase6-seaice.md`)

## Task 6.1 — ice state + cold-start IC + IceConfig

- **[state] σ11/σ12/σ22 are PROGNOSTIC elastic-memory, NOT per-step scratch — they must be
  carried in `State` across ocean steps.** The EVP subcycle's stress update reads the *prior*
  σ (`si1 = det1·(σ11 + σ22 + dte·r1)`, `fesom_ice_evp.c:126-130`) and `EVPdynamics` only
  zeros `inv_areamass/inv_mass/rhs_a/rhs_m` at the top (`:265-270`) — **never σ**. So σ
  persists from the previous ocean step (the "elastic" memory of EVP). It joins
  `a_ice/m_ice/m_snow/u_ice/v_ice/t_skin` as carried ice state. *Lesson: before adding an ice
  field to `State`, check whether the C re-initializes it each step or carries it — σ and
  t_skin (the Newton warm-start) carry; eps/ice_strength/the velocity rhs are per-step
  scratch.* (`fesom_jax/state.py`, Task 6.1.)

- **[config] ⚠️ `Tevp_inv = 3.0/ice_dt` is the `ice_setup` value (`fesom_ice.c:233`), NOT the
  `evp_rheol_steps/ice_dt` written in the `fesom_ice_types.h:177` comment.** The comment is
  stale; the code overrides it in setup (`Tevp_inv = 3.0/ice_dt`, with `ice_dt=500` ⇒ 0.006).
  Also `dte = ice_dt/evp_rheol_steps` and `det1=det2=1/(1+0.5·Tevp_inv·dte)`. Encoded as
  `IceConfig` derived properties so the one definition is the C setup value. *Lesson: when a C
  struct comment and the setup code disagree, the SETUP code wins — grep the `*_setup`/`init`
  for the actual assignment, don't trust the type-declaration comment.* (`fesom_jax/ice.py`
  `IceConfig.Tevp_inv`, Task 6.1.)

- **[state/inert] Adding the 9 inert ice fields to `State` keeps the ocean (pi + Phase-5
  no-ice) path bit-identical — nothing reads them until Phase 6.** They default-zero in
  `State.zeros` and flow through `lax.scan`/`grad` as extra zero leaves (more cotangent leaves,
  all zero). The only test that broke was the explicit field-inventory assertion
  (`test_state.py::test_zeros_shapes_and_dtype`) — a deliberate drift guard, updated to list
  the new fields. *Lesson: a frozen-dataclass pytree tolerates additive inert fields with no
  numeric change; the field-inventory test is the intended tripwire — update it, don't loosen
  it.* (`fesom_jax/state.py`, Task 6.1.)

- **[verify] The cold-start ice IC is C-verified TRANSITIVELY — no new C dump needed.** The
  C `fesom_ice_initial_state` (`fesom_ice.c:246-277`) is a pure threshold rule of the IC
  surface T (`SST<0 ⇒ a_ice=0.9` + hemisphere-split m_ice/m_snow), and the JAX PHC SST already
  matches the C to ~1e-14 (Task 5.2). So the JAX IC matches the C's to the same tolerance; the
  only sensitivity is nodes with `|SST|` within FP noise of 0 — **counted, found 0**
  (`test_ice_ic.test_ic_threshold_not_fp_fragile`). Gated against an independent per-node loop
  reference instead. *Lesson: when a kernel is a pure function of an already-dump-verified
  field, verify it transitively (numpy ref + a threshold-fragility count) rather than spending
  a SLURM C dump.* (`fesom_jax/tests/test_ice_ic.py`, Task 6.1.)

- **[workflow] Probe re-pinning for the ice dumps is env-only (`FESOM_DUMP_PROBES`,
  `fesom_dump.c:19-21`), and the incremental ice configs are env knobs
  (`FESOM_NO_ICE_DYN/ADV/THERMO`) — no C edit to start dumping ice-ON.** Clone
  `jobs/jax_step_dump_core2.sh`, flip the NO_ICE flags, set `FESOM_DUMP_PROBES` to ice
  coverage. The per-substep `fesom_dump.c` does NOT capture ice thermo outputs
  (flx_fw/flx_h/a/m/msnow/t_skin) — those need a small additive all-node dump hook modeled on
  `fesom_bulk_dump` (Task 6.2). *Lesson: the Phase-5 dump harness already supports ice-ON via
  env; the only C addition Phase 6 needs is per-kernel output dumps, not new gates.* (Task 6.1
  prep for 6.2.)

## Task 6.2 — ice thermodynamics

- **[verify] The sea-ice thermodynamics is a per-node MAP (no scatter) and ports BIT-EXACT —
  all 7 outputs match the C dump to MAP-class over all 126858 CORE2 nodes.** h/hsn/A ~1e-16,
  t_skin 5.6e-14, fw 3.5e-19, **ehf rel 4e-10**, thdgr 4.5e-19. The only non-machine field is
  `ehf` (rel 4e-10) — because `ehf = ahf + cl·(dhgrowth + …)` with `cl = rhoice·3.34e5 ≈ 3e8`
  amplifies the ~1e-16 `h` reassociation into ~1e-10 W/m². The dedicated `fesom_ice_thermo_dump`
  (re-runs `therm_ice` on copies → per-node inputs+outputs) makes it a pure feed-the-C-inputs
  MAP gate; config-A (EVP+FCT off) isolates the thermo since the input a/m/snow == the cold-start
  IC. *Lesson: a per-node kernel with a big multiplicative constant (cl) downstream loses a few
  digits in the derived flux even when the prognostic is machine-exact — gate the flux on a
  RELATIVE tolerance scaled by that constant, not an absolute one.* (`test_ice_thermo.py`,
  job 25395803, Task 6.2.)

- **[ad] Runoff activation is provable as an EXACT analytic gradient: `d(fw)/d(runoff) == 1`
  on every node.** Runoff enters at one line (`prec = rain + runo + snow·(1-A)`,
  `fesom_ice_thermo.c:318`) and `fw = prec + evap + fwice + fwsnw`, so `∂fw/∂runo ≡ 1`
  identically — a cleaner gate than any FD. This is the Phase-6 mechanism that turns the
  (Phase-5-inert) runoff back on: once `water_flux = -flx_fw` feeds the existing
  `sss_runoff_fluxes` (Task 6.3), river freshwater reaches the salinity BC. *Lesson: when a
  forcing enters a kernel linearly, gate its activation by the exact analytic derivative
  (`grad == 1`), not a finite difference.* (`test_ice_thermo.test_runoff_activates`, Task 6.2.)

- **[ad] The thermo AD surfaces (the fixed-5 skin-temp Newton, the 4-way albedo `where`, the
  freezing/melt min/max, the masked divides) are all finite — and `d(ehf)/d(SST)` even gives a
  clean FD↔AD plateau (~1e-16) because the thermo is NEAR-LINEAR in SST.** SST enters only via
  `obudget` (smooth exp/pow) + `o2ihf` (linear in `T_oc - Tfrez`); the skin-temp Newton uses
  `S_oc` (not `T_oc`), so varying SST is smooth (no kink) on an interior-ice subset where the
  `max(qhst,0)`/`max(sh,0)`/`min(hsn,…)` melt clamps are inactive. Contrast the Task-5.8
  finding (the *forced multi-step* model is non-smooth): the ISOLATED thermo kernel IS smooth in
  SST, so a quantitative FD↔AD is well-posed here. The masked-NaN guards that mattered:
  `con/hice` (`where(hice>0,hice,1)` — the ice-free class has thact≈0), `/rsss`, the Newton
  `/A3`, `tfrez`'s `√(S³)`. *Lesson: "the model is non-smooth" is about the assembled forced
  trajectory; an isolated per-node kernel can still be smooth in a chosen input — pick that
  input + a kink-free node subset for the per-task FD↔AD.* (`test_ice_thermo.py`, Task 6.2.)

- **[fidelity] The 7-class growth-rate loop sequentially refines the SAME skin temperature `t`
  (each class's 5-iter Newton warm-starts from the previous class's result), and the
  `thick>hmin` gate must mask `t`/`rhice`/`subli` — NOT skip the loop.** In JAX (no Python `if`
  on traced `thick`) the loop runs for all nodes; the ice-free result is masked out
  (`where(thick>hmin, looped, original)`), and `con/hice` is guarded so the ice-free lane (where
  `thact≈0`) stays finite through the masked-out Newton. The snow-accumulation `_dhsngrowth`
  baseline is captured AFTER the snowfall add (`fesom_ice_thermo.c:321-322`), so `dhsngrowth`
  counts only melt, not the snowfall. *Lesson: a C `if(cond){ loop }` over a traced condition
  becomes "run the loop unconditionally + `where`-mask the outputs + guard every divide for the
  masked lane" — the masked lane still executes and still backprops.* (`fesom_jax/ice_thermo.py`
  `therm_ice_cell`, Task 6.2.)

## Task 6.3 — ice-ocean coupling (the runoff handoff)

- **[fidelity] The ice-on `oce_fluxes` reuses the Phase-5 `sss_runoff_fluxes` virtual_salt +
  relax_salt math VERBATIM but DROPS the standalone `water_flux += ⟨water_flux+runoff⟩` term.**
  In ice-on, `water_flux = -flx_fw` (flx_fw already contains runoff via the thermo `prec`), so
  the standalone freshwater-balance term would double-count. Implemented as a backward-compatible
  `balance_water_flux=True` flag on `sss_runoff_fluxes` (default = the Phase-5 no-ice path,
  unchanged; ice-on passes `False`). The Phase-5-verified salt-balance code is reused, not
  re-derived. *Lesson: when a kernel splits into a no-ice and an ice-on variant that share most
  math, add a default-preserving flag to the existing (verified) function rather than forking it
  — the default keeps the old gate green, the flag is the only new surface to test.*
  (`fesom_jax/sss_runoff.py` + `ice_coupling.py`, `fesom_ice_coupling.c:125-179`, Task 6.3.)

- **[ad] The runoff handoff is provable as an EXACT gradient through thermo∘coupling:
  `d(water_flux)/d(runoff) = -1` everywhere.** runoff →(thermo, `d(fw)/d(runo)=1`)→ flx_fw
  →(coupling, `water_flux=-flx_fw`, `balance_water_flux=False` so no mean coupling)→ water_flux,
  giving `∂water_flux/∂runo ≡ -1` (freshwater in). `virtual_salt = S_top·water_flux` with
  `S_top>0` then makes river mouths freshen. ⚠️ Do NOT test freshening via
  `d(Σvirtual_salt)/d(runoff)` — that entangles the area-weighted **global mean** (which flips
  sign on large-area nodes, so only ~85% of river mouths show `<0`); the mean-free `water_flux`
  gradient is the clean signal. *Lesson: gate a forcing handoff on the term WITHOUT the global-
  mean coupling (here `water_flux`, not `virtual_salt`) — a summed-gradient through a
  mean-subtracted field mixes in every node's area weight.* (`test_ice_coupling.py`, Task 6.3.)

- **[verify] `ocean2ice` is free: `srfoce_u/v == uvnode[:,0]`.** The C `ocean2ice`
  (`fesom_ice_coupling.c:84-110`) computes `u_w` as the area-weighted mean of the surrounding
  elements' surface UV — which is **exactly** the recipe that already produced `State.uvnode`
  (the C comment `:44-45` says so), and Phase-5 `core2_forcing` already taps `uvnode[:,0]` for
  the bulk current. So `ocean2ice` is five taps (`T/S[:,0]`, `hbar`, `uvnode[:,0]`), no new
  scatter. *Lesson: before porting a "compute X at nodes" coupling routine, check whether the
  ocean step already computed X under another name — FESOM reuses `uvnode` for the surface
  current.* (`fesom_jax/ice_coupling.py` `ocean2ice`, Task 6.3.)

## Task 6.4 — EVP dynamics (the 120-subcycle scan)

- **[ad] The EVP `Δ = √radicand` singularity is tamed by a double-`where` safe-sqrt THEN the
  C's `max(Δ, delta_min)` clamp — keep `delta_min=1e-11`, do NOT raise it.** At `u_ice=0`
  (every step's subcycle 0) ε=0 ⇒ radicand=0 ⇒ a bare `sqrt` gives a `1/√0=∞` backward even
  though the clamp picks `delta_min` forward (the classic `0·inf` via the non-selected branch).
  `_safe_sqrt(radicand)` returns 0 with a finite gradient, then `jnp.maximum(·, delta_min)`
  reproduces the C value exactly. An EVP-port reflex is to bump `delta_min` to ~1e-8 for
  "stability" — unnecessary here and it would break the bit-exact `Δ` match; the safe-sqrt is
  the right fix. `d(Σσ²)/d(u_ice)` finite at u_ice=0 confirms it. *Lesson: a clamped sqrt
  (`max(sqrt(x), c)`) still needs the double-`where` on `x` — the clamp protects the forward,
  not the backward.* (`fesom_jax/ice_evp.py` `stress_tensor`, Task 6.4.)

- **[ad/perf] The 120 EVP subcycles are a FIXED count → a `jax.checkpoint`ed `lax.scan` with
  carry = (u_ice, v_ice, σ11, σ12, σ22).** σ is the elastic memory (carried, not re-zeroed);
  the scan is checkpointed so the 120-deep backward rematerializes rather than storing every
  subcycle (the inner-loop analog of the outer time-loop checkpointing). `Tevp_inv=3/ice_dt`,
  `dte=ice_dt/120`, `det1=det2=1/(1+0.5·Tevp_inv·dte)`. *Lesson: a fixed inner solver loop is a
  plain `scan` — checkpoint it so it doesn't blow the backward memory when nested in the outer
  step scan (Task 6.7 will measure the combined cost).* (`fesom_jax/ice_evp.py` `evp_dynamics`,
  Task 6.4.)

- **[verify] Ice-free elements must be MASKED in BOTH `stress_tensor` (freeze σ) and
  `stress2rhs` (no contribution), exactly as the C `if (ice_strength<=0) continue` skips them —
  not just one.** `ice_strength=0` unless all 3 vertices have `m_ice>0 AND a_ice>0` (so
  cavity + ice-edge elements are 0). If `stress_tensor` updated their σ (decaying it via det1)
  while `stress2rhs` scattered it, the velocity rhs would pick up spurious stress at the ice
  edge. Freezing σ where `ice_strength≤0` + zeroing the scatter contribution there matches the
  C's double-skip. The step-0 σ/u_rhs gates are **bit-exact** (per-element/node maps, no
  reassociation); only the END after 120 subcycles drifts to ~1e-9 (the accumulated
  element→node scatter reassociation, max|u_ice|=0.21 ⇒ rel ~5e-9). *Lesson: when the C skips an
  element in two consecutive loops, the JAX port must mask it in both — a `where` in the stress
  update AND a `where` in the scatter.* (`fesom_jax/ice_evp.py`, `test_ice_evp.py`, Task 6.4.)

## Task 6.5 — ice FCT advection (the 2-D Zalesak module)

- **[reuse] The entire ice FCT ports CSR-FREE — every step is element gather/scatter, and it
  matches the C BIT-EXACTLY (~1e-15).** The C uses the SSH-stiffness CSR (`rowptr`/`colind`)
  for the mass-matrix product, the cluster bounds, and the flux sums — but all three have an
  element-local form: (a) `(mm·X)[row] = Σ_{elem∋row} area/12·(X[row] + ΣX_elem)` (the FE
  consistent-mass block `area/12·(I+11ᵀ)` scattered — its row sum is the node CV area, so
  `mm·1 = area` falls out, and `mass_matrix_fill` is unnecessary); (b) the Zalesak cluster
  min/max over a node's graph neighbours == `jax.ops.segment_min/max` over the elements
  touching the node (on a triangle mesh, edge-neighbours == element-co-vertices); (c) the +/−
  flux sums are element→node `scatter_add`. So no CSR is ported. The single-step FCT matched the
  C to ~1e-15 (not the ~1e-12 scatter floor — the cold-start IC has little cancellation).
  *Lesson: before porting a CSR-based FE kernel, check whether each sparse op (matvec, neighbour
  min/max) has an element-local form — for a P1 triangle mesh they usually do, and the
  element-scatter port is simpler AND avoids threading the CSR.* (`fesom_jax/ice_adv.py`,
  job 25396145, Task 6.5.)

- **[fidelity] Use the ice FCT's OWN limiter floor `1e-12` (`fesom_ice_fct.c:458`), NOT the
  ocean FCT's `1e-16` — match each kernel's own constant.** The deep-read brief recommended
  unifying on 1e-16 for "AD stability", but the golden rule wins: with 1e-16 the JAX limiter
  ratio would differ from the C wherever the flux sum sits in (1e-16, 1e-12), breaking the
  bit-exact dump match. 1e-12 is already a finite floor ⇒ NaN-safe; AD doesn't need it tighter.
  Also: **no positivity clip** (the C doesn't) — the small antidiffusive overshoot past a_ice=0.9
  (~0.0019) is FCT-physical and IDENTICAL in JAX and C; `cut_off` clamps a≤1 afterward. *Lesson:
  a deep-read's "improve it" suggestion (tighter eps, add a clip) is subordinate to bit-exact
  fidelity — port the C's constant, let the documented downstream guard (cut_off) do the
  clamping.* (`fesom_jax/ice_adv.py` `_fem_fct`, `test_ice_adv.py`, Task 6.5.)

## Task 6.6 — assemble the ice step

- **[verify] The per-kernel gates are BIT-EXACT; the ASSEMBLED multi-kernel step is
  climate-close (~1e-6) — the 120-subcycle EVP floor propagates.** Each ice kernel matches the
  C to ~1e-15 (thermo, FCT) or step-0 bit-exact (EVP), but the EVP's END velocity carries a
  ~1e-9 scatter-reassociation floor (120 subcycles, Task 6.4), and `u_ice` feeds ustar (thermo),
  the ice-ocean stress (momentum) and the FCT — so the assembled step-1 post-step T/S match the
  C dump at ~1e-6, NOT bit-exact. This is the right gate altitude: verify each kernel tight in
  isolation (its own dump), accept climate-close for the assembled trajectory (the Phase-5
  multi-step gates were ~1e-9 too). *Lesson: don't chase bit-exactness on an assembled step that
  contains a reassociating iterative solver — gate the kernels tight, gate the assembly
  climate-close.* (`fesom_jax/ice_step.py`, `test_ice_step.py`, Task 6.6.)

- **[design] `ice_cfg` is a STATIC jit arg (an `IceConfig` NamedTuple — hashable), `None` ⇒ the
  pi/Phase-5 path is bit-identical.** Threading the whole ice subsystem through `step`/`integrate`
  needed exactly one new arg: `ice_cfg=None`. When `None`, the ice branch is a dead Python `if`
  (no trace), so the 376 pi + 63 Phase-5 CORE2 gates are untouched; when an `IceConfig`, the ice
  step runs and its prognostic a_ice/u_ice replace the static mask in the two existing couplings.
  The `IceConfig` properties (`cc`/`cl`/`Tevp_inv`/…) bake in as trace-time constants. *Lesson:
  gate a big new subsystem behind one static config arg defaulting to None — the old path stays
  a compile-time dead branch (bit-identical), the new path is opt-in.* (`fesom_jax/step.py`
  `step_jit`, Task 6.6.)

- **[workflow] ⚠️ Do NOT run two heavy CPU-JAX processes on the login node at once — XLA's
  CPU threadpool init (`pthread_create`) hits the per-user thread/process limit and one crashes
  (a faulthandler dump at `PjRtCpuClient`, NOT a code bug).** A CPU stability-smoke launched
  while the full pytest suite was running crashed both. The fix: run ONE CPU-JAX job at a time
  (background the suite, don't launch a second), and put heavy runs on the GPU (separate node).
  Also: `pytest … | tail` reports `tail`'s exit code (0) even when pytest crashes — grep the
  output for "passed", don't trust the pipe's exit. *Lesson: serialize CPU-JAX on the login
  node; verify a backgrounded suite by its "N passed" line, not the pipe exit code.* (Task 6.6.)

## Task 6.7 — GATE 6: stability + gradient (PHASE 6 COMPLETE)

- **[physics] ✅ SEA ICE CAPS THE SUPERCOOLING — the defining Phase-6 result.** The Phase-5
  no-ice CORE2 run supercooled the high-lat SST without bound (−1.9 IC → −16.5 day 5 → −22.8
  day 8 → max|vel|>3 blow-up ~day 8). WITH prognostic sea ice the thermo `o2ihf` (ocean→ice
  heat flux) + the freezing point pin SST_min at **−1.91 °C** (the local freezing point) for the
  whole 10-day run, which stays numerically stable (max|vel|=2.72<3, |SSH|<2.1, no NaN); ice
  grows physically (m_ice→2.94 m, a=1.0, extent ~2.5e13 m², drift ~1 m/s). Both standing Phase-5
  findings (supercooling, inert runoff) are now RESOLVED. *Lesson: the no-ice supercooling was
  exactly the PHYSICAL gap the C-port-matched model predicted; porting the ice thermo (not any
  numerical band-aid) is what fixes it — vindicating the "match the C, the limitation is real"
  call.* (`scripts/core2_ice_stability_run.py`, job 25396309, Task 6.7.)

- **[ad] The assembled-ice backward is AD-SAFE (masked-NaN clean) but the EVP IC-gradient is
  STIFF (~1e16, finite) via `1/delta_min` — this is fine for the ML use case.** `d(SST)/d(T0)`
  on the N=4 ice model is finite everywhere, exactly 0 on masked lanes, nonzero on wet (the
  backward flows through the thermo Newton + the 120-subcycle EVP scan + the FCT limiter + every
  masked guard). But the wet magnitude reaches ~1e16: `zeta = ice_strength/delta_clamped·Tevp_inv`
  with `delta_min=1e-11` gives `zeta ~ 1e15` at rigid ice, and `d(stress)/d(eps) ~ zeta`
  propagates that. This is the GENUINE plastic-rheology stiffness (the EVP is nearly
  non-differentiable at rigid ice), not a bug — it's finite (the gate's criterion). For Phase-7
  TRAINING the NN-parameter gradients flow through the `k_ver`/`a_ver` mixing seam — `d(SST)/
  d(k_ver)` is well-conditioned (FD↔AD plateau **4.5e-10**) — NOT through the EVP `1/delta`. So
  the stiff EVP IC-gradient is a documented characteristic, not a blocker; if a future objective
  needs ice-dynamics gradients, raise `delta_min` for the gradient or `stop_gradient` the EVP.
  *Lesson: a finite-but-huge gradient through a plastic/iterative solver is the solver's
  conditioning, not a NaN bug — gate on finiteness, and confirm the ACTUAL trainable path (the
  mixing seam) is well-conditioned separately.* (`scripts/core2_ice_grad_gate.py` [1]/[3],
  job 25396293, Task 6.7.)

- **[memory] Two CORE2-ice GPU memory traps on the A100-40: (a) stacking the per-step forcing,
  (b) >1 N-step backward per process.** (a) `cf.stack(dates_for_steps(1728))` puts ALL 1728
  steps × ~10 fields × nod2D × f8 ≈ **17.5 GB** of forcing resident on the GPU at once → the
  model OOMs; fix = generate `cf.step_forcing(*dates[i])` per step in the loop (tiny). (b) the
  grad gate ran 3 separate N=4 backwards (`d/d(k_ver)`, `d/d(T0)`, `d/d(m_ice0)`) in one process;
  each compiles a fresh reverse graph (~26.5 GB peak) and they accumulate → the 3rd OOMs;
  fix = `jax.clear_caches()` between probes, or one probe per job, or the A100-80. *Lesson: on a
  40 GB card, don't hold the whole forcing trajectory resident (stream it per step) and run one
  heavy backward per process.* (`core2_ice_stability_run.py`, `core2_ice_grad_gate.py`, Task 6.7.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.1 — sw_alpha_beta + the seam + the dump hook)

- **[eos] `sw_alpha_beta` (McDougall 1987) is a bit-exact pointwise map — max|Δ|=0 vs the C over
  all 3.7M CORE2 wet lanes, like `density`.** The two coefficients (`sw_beta` = the 10-term
  saline-contraction polynomial; `sw_alpha = a_over_b·beta`, `a_over_b` the 11-term ratio) are
  written **term-by-term** in the C (`fesom_eos.c:336-369`), NOT Horner — mirror that exact
  left-to-right grouping and it matches bit-for-bit on CPU-eager (no FMA divergence; same
  expectation as the JM `density`). Inputs `t1=T·1.00024`, `p1=|Z[nz]|` (pressure proxy), `s35=S−35`.
  Smooth (no sqrt/divide) ⇒ trivially AD-finite, no guards. (`eos.compute_sw_alpha_beta`, G.1.)

- **[eos/mesh] ⚠️ `mesh.Z` is `[nl-1]` (layer midpoints), NOT `[nl]` — pad to `[nl]` like
  `pressure_bv` does.** `mesh.zbar` is the `[nl]` interface depths; `mesh.Z` (layer-centre depths)
  has one fewer entry. The C indexes `Z[nz]` over the layer range `[nzmin, nzmax)` (max index
  nl-2), so it never overflows; in vectorized JAX you must broadcast `Z` against `[N, nl]`, so pad
  `Zp = concat([Z, Z[-1:]])` (the padded tail is below-bottom → masked out). Got a
  `(N,48)+(1,47)` broadcast error until padded. (`eos.compute_sw_alpha_beta`, G.1.)

- **[ad/ml-hook] The 2nd ML-hook seam (GM/Redi eddy diffusivities `k_gm`/`redi_kmax`) extends
  `Params` with `dataclasses.field(default_factory=…)` defaults — so the old `Params(k_ver=,
  a_ver=)` 2-arg construction stays valid AND the pytree round-trips.** Adding leaves to a
  registered-dataclass pytree changes its structure; giving the new leaves config-constant
  defaults (via `default_factory`, NOT a bare array default) keeps every existing constructor +
  the 17-test gradient/integrate seam **bit-identical** (when GM is off the leaves are unused ⇒
  `d/d(k_gm)=0`, finite). Mirror of how `k_ver`/`a_ver` seamed the 1st hook in Phase 3.
  (`params.py`, `config.K_GM_MAX/REDI_KMAX`, G.1.)

- **[verify] GM/Redi is STATELESS, so its dump hook just SNAPSHOTS the already-computed arrays
  all-node — no re-run-on-copies (unlike the ice-thermo dump).** Every GM field (`sigma_xy`,
  slopes, `fer_K`, `Ki`, `fer_gamma`, `fer_uv`, …) is recomputed each step from T/S/N², so after
  the GM coefficient block (`fesom_step.c:124-130`) the `gm->*`/`dyn->fer_uv`/`aux->sw_*` arrays
  are exactly the outputs — `fesom_gm_dump` `fwrite`s them as raw f64 blobs (C row-major) +
  `gm_meta.txt`. **Dump the INPUTS too** (`T,S,bvfreq,hnode,hnode_new`) so ONE GM-ON dataset
  (`data/gm_dump_core2/`, job 25397273) feeds the JAX kernels the C inputs and gates G.1-G.4
  output-for-output. GM is mixing-independent ⇒ dump with `FESOM_MIX_SCHEME=PP` + ice OFF +
  `FESOM_NO_GMREDI` dropped. Reader: `io_dump.load_gm_dump`. (`fesom_step.c fesom_gm_dump`, G.1.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.2 — neutral slopes)

- **[gm] `compute_sigma_xy` is the `eos.smooth_nod3D` element→node area-weighted scatter, but
  ÷Σarea (not 3·Σarea) and carrying the per-element ∇T/∇S.** Per node: ⟨∇_c T⟩ =
  Σ_{el∋n}(area_el·∇_c T_el)/Σarea_el, then `sigma_xy = (-α⟨∇T⟩ + β⟨∇S⟩)·ρ0`. Vectorize: per-
  element gradient `∇T_el = Σ_v gradient_sca[:,v]·T[elem_nodes[:,v]]` ((E,nl)), stack the 4 grads +
  the area into one (E,nl,5) tensor, broadcast to the 3 vertices, ONE `ops.scatter_add` →
  (N,nl,5), split → tx/ty/sx/sy/vol; `inv_vol = where(vol>0,1/vol,0)`. Bit-exact vs the C dump
  (el-range ⊆ node-range ⇒ `elem_layer_mask` suffices, same as the smoother). (`gm.compute_sigma_xy`,
  `fesom_gm.c:124`, G.2.)

- **[gm/verify] ⚠️ `neutral_slope` (UNTAPERED) has enormous dynamic range — slopes reach ~1e5-1e6
  where N²→the eps² floor — so gate it RELATIVE, never absolute.** `ro_z_inv = 2g/ρ/max(N²,eps²)`
  with `eps²=2.5e-11` ⇒ `ro_z_inv` up to ~8e8, and `slope = sigma_xy·ro_z_inv` reaches ~3e5 at
  weakly-stratified deep lanes. An absolute 1e-13 gate is meaningless there (max|val|~1e5); the
  field is eager-bit-exact vs the C but a ~1e-15 *relative* shift = ~1e-10 absolute. Gate
  `|Δ| ≤ atol + rtol·|ref|` (rtol=1e-12). The physically-consumed field is `slope_tapered` (the
  taper kills these huge slopes). (`test_gm_slopes`, G.2.)

- **[gm/fma] ⚠️ `slope_tapered = neutral_slope·√c1` has a `huge×tiny ≈ 0` lane (huge untapered
  slope × taper→0) whose result ~1e-10 carries the huge factor's FMA noise (~4e-10 abs) — gate
  isclose with a NEAR-ZERO ABSOLUTE FLOOR (atol≈1e-9), not pure-relative (rel>1 there).** And the
  XLA FMA-contraction of `√(sx²+sy²)` is the density-lesson effect AGAIN: **eager is bit-exact
  (max|Δ|=0) vs the C, but a fused path (jit, or eager under some process states) shifts it ~2e-16
  relative (machine-ε)** — and WHICH of neutral_slope/slope_tapered shows it varies run-to-run with
  the fusion decision. The lane IS ~zero slope (negligible Redi flux). (`test_gm_slopes`, G.2.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.3 — init_redi_gm + the 2nd ML-hook)

- **[gm] `init_redi_gm` has two level-bound regimes — F1 uses the CONSERVATIVE bounds
  (`ulevels_nod2D_max`/`nlevels_nod2D_min`), F2 the REGULAR (`ulevels_nod2D`/`nlevels_nod2D`).**
  F1: resolution `scaling = min(√(area_surf·2/refscalresol²), 1)`, `fer_K_top=max(scaling·k_gm,
  K_GM_min)`, `Ki_top=max(scaling·redi_kmax, K_GM_min)`, and the baroclinic wave speed
  `cm = max(Σ_cons hnode·½(√bv0+√bv1)/π/K_GM_cm, K_GM_cmin)` (a depth REDUCTION over the
  conservative range → `fer_C=cm²`, scatter/reduction class ~1e-15). F2: `zscaling =
  clip(smin+(1−smin)e^{−|z|/zref}, smin, 1)`; `fer_K = fer_K_top·zscaling` on the **iface** range
  (`node_iface_mask`); `Ki = Ki_top·½(zscaling[nz]+zscaling[nz+1])` on the **layer** range, then
  the taper. For no-cavity CORE2 the conservative/regular *upper* bound collapses (ulevels≡1 ⇒
  nzmin=0) but the *lower* differs (cm integrates only to the shallowest surrounding cell's
  bottom). Verified map-class vs the dump. (`gm.init_redi_gm`, `fesom_gm.c:345`, G.3.)

- **[gm/ad/ml-hook] The 2nd ML-hook gradient is LIVE: `d(Σfer_K)/d(k_gm)=2.03e6` (finite,
  positive) flows through `init_redi_gm`.** `k_gm`/`redi_kmax` thread from `Params` →
  `fer_K_top`/`Ki_top` = `max(scaling·k_gm, K_GM_min)`; `d/d(k_gm)=Σ scaling·zscaling` over the
  iface range (the `max` unclamped at the default 1000). The `Redi_Ktaper`
  `Ki·√c1 + Redi_Kmin·|√c1−1|` ⇒ where the taper kills c1 (unstable strat bv≤0, c1=0),
  `Ki=Redi_Kmin=100` — matches the C. Same seam pattern as `k_ver`/`a_ver` (Phase 3); Phase 7
  swaps the NN here. (`params.py`, `test_gm_coeffs`, G.3.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.4 — streamfunction TDMA + bolus velocity)

- **[gm] `fer_solve_gamma`'s tridiagonal geometry is a STATIC precomputed constant in full-cell
  linfs (`zbar_n=zbar`, `Z_n=Z`) — verified `hnode_new == zbar thickness` bit-exact (max|Δ|=0).**
  So `a[nz]=fer_C·(1/(zbar[nz-1]−zbar[nz]))·(1/(Z[nz-1]−Z[nz]))`, `c` similarly with the lower
  iface spacing, `b=−a−c−max(N²,1e-8)` — only `fer_C`/`bvfreq`/`fer_K`/`sigma_xy` vary per node.
  Build the body coefficients on `[nzmin+1,nzmax)` (conservative inner bounds), set the
  Dirichlet/padding rows to `b=1, a=c=d=0` (→ Γ=0), and the full-column `ops.tdma` reproduces the
  C's bounded Thomas sweep exactly. The two components (x,y) SHARE the matrix → two `ops.tdma`
  calls with the same `(a,b,c)`. **`fer_gamma` matched ~8.9e-15** (sequential Thomas ≈ bit-exact).
  (`gm.fer_solve_gamma`, `fesom_gm.c:492`, G.4.)

- **[gm] `fer_gamma2vel` (bolus velocity) is a gather + interface-difference ÷helem — ~1e-16,
  essentially bit-exact.** `fer_uv(c,nz,el) = (1/3)·(Σ_v Γ[v,nz,c] − Σ_v Γ[v,nz+1,c])/helem`:
  gather Γ to the 3 vertices, sum, difference adjacent interfaces, ÷`helem` (safe-divide
  `where(h>0,h,1)`), mask to `elem_layer_mask & h>0`. `helem` (static linfs) = `⅓Σ_v hnode` =
  `gather_nodes_to_elem(hnode).mean(axis=1)`. (`gm.fer_gamma2vel`, `fesom_gm.c:1035`, G.4.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.5 — the GM driver + the bolus vertical velocity)

- **[gm] ⚠️ `fer_w = ale.compute_w(fer_uv)` — a PURE REUSE of the dump-verified `compute_w`, no new
  kernel.** The C computes the bolus vertical velocity with the byte-identical edge→node
  transport-divergence scatter + reverse-cumsum + ÷area as `w`, just driven by `fer_uv` instead of
  `uv` (`fesom_ale.c:124-152,166-186` — `c2` mirrors `c1`). So `fer_w = compute_w(mesh, fer_uv,
  helem)`; verified by composition (compute_w bit-exact vs the `w` dump in test_ale + fer_uv
  ~1e-16 in G.4) + the no-flux BC (`fer_w[nzmax]=0` exact, the bolus is divergence-free/
  streamfunction-derived) + activity (max|fer_w|~3e-4). The C wraps tracer advection with
  `uv+=fer_uv; w_e+=fer_w` and subtracts after; in functional JAX just PASS `uv+fer_uv`,
  `w_e+fer_w` into the advection — the carried `uv`/`w_e` are untouched, so the subtract-back is
  automatic. (`gm`, `fesom_step.c:312-332`, G.5.)

- **[gm] `gm_diagnostics` composes G.1-G.4 (sw_alpha_beta→sigma_xy→neutral_slope→init_redi_gm→
  fer_solve_gamma→fer_gamma2vel) and reproduces `fer_uv` END-TO-END at 2.2e-16** (essentially
  bit-exact) fed the C's T/S/bvfreq/hnode_new — the strongest GM gate (the whole chain, all-node).
  It returns `(fer_uv, slope_tapered, Ki, fer_K, fer_C)` — `fer_uv` drives the bolus (G.5),
  `slope_tapered`/`Ki` the Redi terms (G.6). `d(Σfer_uv²)/d(T)` through the full chain (incl. the
  TDMA) finite + nonzero. (`gm.gm_diagnostics`, G.5.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.6 — the Redi tracer terms)

- **[gm/redi] ⚠️ G7b's 5 partial-cell branches A/B/C/D/E collapse to 3 CASES by level-membership
  `(in1=nz∈el1, in2=nz∈el2)`: el1-only (A∪D), el2-only (B∪E), both (C).** A and D are the SAME
  formula (el1-only, above vs below the overlap); B and E likewise. So per (edge, level) select
  `(Tx, Ty, dz, CX, CY)` by the 3 cases (`both/only1/only2` from `elem_layer_mask[el1/el2]`):
  `c = (CX·Fx + CY·Fy)·dz`, `Fx=Kh(Tx+SxTz)`; el1-only `CX=dyL,CY=−dxL`; el2-only `CX=−dyR,CY=dxR`;
  both `CX=dyL−dyR,CY=dxR−dxL`. The node-endpoint `Kh/SxTz/SyTz` (the `COMPUTE_KH_TZ_S` macro) are
  the SAME in all branches. Antisymmetric edge→node scatter (`+c→e1,−c→e2`), then
  `÷(areasvol·hnode_new)`. **Matched the C at 1.07e-14 first try** — the same "5-zones→masked-sum"
  collapse as the ocean upwind advection. (`gm_redi.diff_part_hor_redi`, `fesom_gm.c:824`, G.6.)

- **[gm/redi] ⚠️ The Redi K33 is just "AUGMENT Kv" — `Ty(nz)==Ty1(nz-1)` is ONE per-interface value,
  and `impl_vert_diff` already builds `a[nz]∝Kv[nz]`, `c[nz]∝Kv[nz+1]`, so passing `Kv+K33_aug`
  reproduces the C's `a∝(Kv[nz]+Ty)`, `c∝(Kv[nz+1]+Ty1)` with NO change to the diffusion kernel.**
  `K33_aug[k] = (geo_up·zinv)·s[k-1]²Ki[k-1] + (geo_dn·zinv)·s[k]²Ki[k]` (`s`=`slope_tapered[...,2]`
  the |slope|, static linfs geometry). The (3,3) Redi-tensor term = the isoneutral vertical
  diffusivity. (`gm_redi.k33_augmentation`, `fesom_tracer_diff.c:167-246`, G.6.)

- **[gm/redi/verify] The G7a/G7b explicit terms read `valuesold` (the AB2 pre-step T) for their
  gradients but APPLY to the post-advection T — gate by capturing T before/after each Redi piece
  all-node.** The C composes the Fortran `del_ttf` accumulation + `ale_reconstruct`, so in JAX each
  is a `delta` added to T with the `/(areasvol·hnode_new)` factor. The `fesom_redi_blob` hook
  (`FESOM_REDI_DUMP_DIR`) dumps `T_old/T_pre/T_g7a/T_g7b/tr_xy/tr_z` all-node ⇒ gate `T_pre+G7a==
  T_g7a`, `T_g7a+G7b==T_g7b` exactly (the dt is `fesom_phase1_dt`=the runtime 500, NOT a separate
  constant). (`fesom_step.c fesom_redi_blob`, `test_gm_redi`, G.6.)

## Phase 6B — GM/Redi (Task G.7 — assemble + GATE 6B)

- **[gm/step] ⚠️ The assembled GM/Redi step is BIT-EXACT class (7e-15), NOT climate-close — because
  GM/Redi is fully deterministic (no EVP-like reassociation floor).** The full GM-ON CORE2 step-1
  post-step T/S match the C GM-ON substep dump (`gm_step_dump_core2`) at **T 7.1e-15 / S 2.1e-14** —
  the same bit-exact class as the per-kernel G.1-G.6 gates, NOT the ice assembly's ~1e-6 (whose
  120-subcycle EVP END velocity carries a ~1e-9 floor, Task 6.6). The whole chain — bolus advection
  + G7a + G7b + K33 — is pure map/scatter, so it composes without an iterative-solver floor. This
  also **CLOSES K33's tight gate**: K33 had no isolated dump (G.6 only sanity-checked it); the
  assembled 7e-15 match is its tight validation. Step 2 is scatter-class (1.2e-9, the CG iter-count
  amplifying step-1's spread, bounded). *Lesson: gate an assembled step at the altitude of its
  LEAST-deterministic kernel — bit-exact if all-deterministic (GM), climate-close if it contains a
  reassociating iterative solver (ice EVP).* (`test_gm_step.py`, G.7.)

- **[gm/step] ⚠️ The Redi G7a/G7b read the PRE-step tracer = `st.T`/`st.S` (the `T_old` RETURNED by
  `advect_one_fct`), NOT the AB2 history `st.T_old`.** The C's `valuesold` at Redi time is what
  `init_tracers_AB_one` saved DURING this step's advect call = the pre-step `values` = `st.T` (which
  `advect_one_fct` returns as `T_old_new`). `st.T_old` (the carry going IN) is the PREVIOUS step's
  pre-step T — different at step ≥2. At step 1 they coincide, so a single-step gate would NOT catch
  the bug; the step-2 evolution gate (1.2e-9, bounded) is what confirms it. The bolus wrap is
  functional: pass `uv+fer_uv`, `w_e+fer_w` into advection (the carried uv/w_e untouched ⇒ the C's
  post-diffusion subtract-back is automatic); `hnode_new` is hoisted once after EOS (static linfs)
  so the GM block (substep 2) and the Redi reconstruction (substep 15) share it; K33 augments Kv
  before `impl_vert_diff` (no diffusion-kernel change). `gm_cfg=None` ⇒ a dead Python branch ⇒
  bit-identical (the `ice_cfg` precedent; the full 453-test suite stays green). (`step.py`, G.7.)

- **[gm/ad/ml-hook] ✅ The 2nd ML-hook gradient `d(SST)/d(k_gm)` is WELL-CONDITIONED (clean FD↔AD
  plateau 3.5e-6), NOT stiff — the risk-list worry was unfounded.** The eddy-flux hook plateau is
  the textbook V-shape (truncation error at large h, round-off at small, min at h=1e-5), unlike the
  EVP's `1/delta_min` stiffness (~1e16, Task 6.7). Both ML hooks are now training-ready end-to-end on
  the assembled CORE2 model: `d/d(k_ver)` plateau 5.8e-10, `d/d(k_gm)` 3.5e-6, masked-NaN `d/d(T0)`
  finite everywhere / 0 on dry / nonzero wet (the backward flows through the GM slopes safe-sqrt,
  the streamfunction TDMA, the Redi scatters). Backward memory at N=4 CORE2 GM-ON = **37 GB / 64 GB**
  (the per-step GM TDMA + Redi scatters add to the backward; the A100-80 is comfortable, the -40
  would be tight at N=4). (`scripts/core2_gm_grad_gate.py`, job 25402381, G.7.)

- **[gm/physics] ✅ GM does PHYSICAL WORK — it smooths fronts: 10-day front |∇T| 7.42e-6 (GM-ON) vs
  7.89e-6 (GM-OFF), a ~6% reduction that GROWS monotonically (d1 6.72/6.82 → d10 7.42/7.89).** The
  bolus advection + Redi neutral diffusion flatten isopycnals (the eddy parameterization is active,
  not inert). Both runs 10-day stable (max|vel| 2.84/2.72 < 3, SST capped −1.91 by the ice thermo,
  no NaN). The within-step DYNAMICS (SSH, |vel|) are GM-INDEPENDENT — identical between GM-ON/OFF —
  because the bolus only redistributes tracers and is subtracted back before momentum/SSH; GM acts
  purely on T/S. GPU steady-state is ~0.09 s/step (the 8-9 s I saw at s1/s2 was compile + the first
  device_get sync), so the full 1728-step (10-day) run finishes in ~4 min. *Lesson: verify a
  parameterization is doing work with a matched ON/OFF run on a physical diagnostic (front
  sharpness), not just "it ran stably".* (`scripts/core2_gm_stability_run.py`, jobs 25402379/80, G.7.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (planning + research; the pivot to finish the full model)

- **[process/pivot] After GATE 6B the user redirected: finish the full FUNCTIONING model (KPP) BEFORE
  the Phase-7a parameter-tuning on-ramp.** Phase 7a was scoped (the `calibrate.py` seam + the
  perfect-model `k_gm` twin) and two facts were verified before the pivot — preserved in
  `docs/plans/20260607-fesom-jax-paramtune.md`: (1) **`optax 0.2.8` installed clean** (pip dry-run
  confirmed jax/jaxlib 0.10.1 untouched; only `optax`+`absl-py` added); (2) **the `k_gm` twin is
  well-posed** — `gm.py:198` `k_top=max(scaling·k_gm, k_gm_min=2.0)` has **only a lower floor, no
  upper clamp at `k_gm_max=1000`**, so injecting `k_gm=1500` is unclamped, `fer_K ∝ k_gm` linearly.
  *Lesson: when the user redirects mid-scope, capture the in-flight design + any verified de-risking
  into a deferred plan so zero work is lost; don't just drop it.*

- **[kpp/framing] ⚠️ KPP is the *real* FESOM2 CORE2 default mixing scheme (`mix_scheme='KPP'`,
  `mix_scheme_nmb=1`); the JAX port has been running the OPT-IN PP (`pp.py`, `nmb=2`) all along.** The
  C dispatch (`fesom_step.c:257` KPP / `:259` PP, selected by `FESOM_MIX_SCHEME`; default KPP since
  `8d0cdbc`) and the GM/Redi sub-plan (`20260607-fesom-jax-gmredi.md:49-51`) both confirm it — the GM
  dump ran on `FESOM_MIX_SCHEME=PP` to match the JAX port. So **every JAX gate to date is PP-vs-PP**;
  porting KPP brings the model to the production config. *Lesson: verify which branch the "default"
  config actually selects — the reduced-namelist port matched PP because that's what the dumps used,
  not because PP is the model's default.*

- **[kpp/validation] CONTROLLED REPLAY is the load-bearing validation technique for forcing-amplifying
  kernels.** The C KPP port found a **live-run** dump diffs at **~52 % of nodes** vs Fortran — NOT an
  algebra bug, but the **step-1 surface-forcing transient** (a known C↔Fortran flux mismatch)
  perturbing `bfsfc`/`ustar` at ~every node, which `blmix` amplifies (`f1 ∝ bfsfc/ustar⁴`). A
  whole-field live diff is uninterpretable. The fix: **inject the reference-dumped INPUTS into the
  kernel under test, diff only its OUTPUTS** → isolates algebra from forcing noise → bit-faithful
  (C hit max|Δ|=3.18e-13). The JAX port must adopt this per-kernel (K.2–K.7), gating against the
  **C** (the JAX SoT, already Fortran-validated K0–K11, climate RMS 0.005–0.013 °C). The end-to-end
  check is the **climate gate**: JAX-KPP ≈ C-KPP ≪ the genuine PP↔KPP scheme gap (~0.085 °C, ~18×).

- **[kpp/ad] KPP is the kink-heaviest scheme yet — it has STRUCTURAL discreteness PP/GM did not.** The
  AD bar stays "no NaN/Inf in backward, finite incl. masked lanes" + a clean gradient where one
  physically exists. Inventory + treatments (full list in `…-kpp.md` §4): (1) **`ustar =
  sqrt(sqrt(|τ|/ρ₀))`** double-sqrt — ∞ backward slope at zero wind, and `ustar` sits in many
  denominators (`u*⁴` in `f1`, `u*³` in `hmonob`) → `_safe_sqrt`, the #1 priority. (2) the **OBL depth
  `kbl`** chosen by a thresholded bulk-Ri search (+ the `wscale` `int()` bin index, `caseA` sign) is
  discrete → vectorize as a masked first-crossing, **`stop_gradient` the integer index** but keep the
  **`hbl` interpolation weight differentiable** ("which level" discrete, "where within" smooth — same
  treatment as the FCT/upwind kinks). (3) the **`EPSLN=1e-40` denominators** stop Inf but NOT gradient
  blow-up (`d(1/den)/d ~ 1/den²` is huge at 1e-40) → replace with **physical floors** on the
  physically-small ones (`/(Rib_k−Rib_km1+ε)`, `bfsfc/u*⁴`, `hekman/max(|f|,ε)`). *Lesson: `+1e-40`
  is a forward-Inf guard, not an AD guard — audit every such denominator for backward conditioning.*

- **[kpp/seam] The C KPP port is DONE + validated → port FROM it, mirror its K0–K11 decomposition, and
  the only missing JAX input is `dbsfc`.** Input audit at the seam (`step.py:130`): `bvfreq` ✓,
  `eos.compute_sw_alpha_beta` ✓ (GM added it), `heat_flux`/`water_flux`/`stress_node_surf`/`sw_3d` ✓
  (in the CORE2 forcing, thread them to the call), `uvnode` ✓ (reuse `pp.compute_vel_nodes`) — but
  **`dbsfc` (the EOS surface-buoyancy difference, `Ritop=zk·dbsfc`) is NOT computed under PP**
  (`eos.py:7` says so) → **add it in K.5** (mirror `fesom_eos.c`). KPP follows the `gm_cfg`/`ice_cfg`
  static-config gate exactly (`kpp_cfg=None ⇒ PP bit-identical`); it is STATELESS (no new `State`
  fields, like GM); double diffusion + nonlocal flux are GATE-ONLY for CORE2. (Phase 6C planning,
  `docs/plans/20260607-fesom-jax-kpp.md`.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Task K.0 — scaffolding + reference dumps)

- **[kpp/scaffold] `kpp_cfg=None` threads bit-identically exactly like `gm_cfg` — verified `kpp_cfg=None
  ⇔ KppConfig()` give max|ΔT|=max|Δuv|=0 through both `step_jit` AND the checkpointed `integrate`
  (scan body).** `KppConfig(NamedTuple)` is plain Python scalars/bools ⇒ hashable ⇒ a valid
  `static_argname` (the GM/ice precedent); KPP carries NO differentiable leaves of its own (the
  seam tunables stay in `Params`; `Ricr`/`visc_sh_limit`/backgrounds become Phase-7a targets there).
  Threaded `step.py` (`:53` sig, `step_jit`+`run` static_argnames) + `integrate.py` (sig, both the pi
  eager+scan and CORE2 eager+scan bodies, `integrate_jit` static_argnames). The arg is THREADED but
  UNUSED through K.0 (the `if kpp_cfg: kpp.mixing_kpp` gate is K.8) — an unused static arg is free.
  (`fesom_jax/kpp.py`, `step.py`, `integrate.py`, K.0.)

- **[kpp/init] ⚠️ The derived scalars `Vtc/cg/deltaz/deltau` AND the full 892×480 wm/ws lookup table
  recompute BIT-EXACTLY (max|Δ|=0) vs the C dump — so K.1's table builder is already pre-validated by
  the K.0 reader check.** Compute the derived scalars at module load with `math.sqrt`/`math.pow` (the
  same libm routines the C `pow()` calls ⇒ bit-equal), VERBATIM from `fesom_kpp.c:130-138` (do NOT
  re-derive Vtc/cg from a paper — research disagreed; trust the C association). They are frozen at the
  CORE2 values in `KppConfig` (NOT auto-recomputed from the tuple's own fields — re-derive if Ricr/concv
  change under Phase-7a). The table-build `pow(conas·u³−concs·zehat, 1/3)` base can go negative → the
  K.1 builder must clamp ≥0 (the table is a constant → build once, freeze, no grad). (`kpp.py`
  `_VTC`/`_CG`/`_DELTAZ`/`_DELTAU`, `io_dump.load_kpp_init`, K.0/K.1.)

- **[kpp/dump] The C KPP dump is plain TEXT (not the GM `.f64` binary): one `kpp_dump_s<step>_<tag>_rank<R>.txt`
  per kernel field + `kpp_init_rank0.txt` + `kpp_wscale_rank0.txt`.** Run single-rank (`--ntasks=1`),
  so `*_rank0.txt` carries every node (gid 1..N) in `myList` order, and (single-rank) JAX node `i` ↔
  global gid `i+1` (the GM-gate node alignment, made explicit) — `load_kpp_dump` reorders by gid
  (`out[gid-1]=row`, robust to partition order; verified gids are the identity here). Fast parse via
  `np.fromstring(sep=' ')` (1.5 s for the 90 MB `dVsq`). The dump job isolates KPP (`FESOM_MIX_SCHEME=KPP`,
  GM OFF, ice OFF — the controlled-replay gate feeds C inputs so config doesn't affect validity; ice OFF
  drops EVP noise) — 57 s, ~890 MB text, all step-1. A 10-comp `iceforce` ice-debug tag shares the dir
  (reuses the harness; harmless — gates request named tags). (`jax_kpp_dump_core2.sh`,
  `io_dump.{read_kpp_table,load_kpp_dump,load_kpp_init,load_kpp_wscale_sweep}`, K.0.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Tasks K.1 + K.2 — lookup tables + wscale)

- **[kpp] The wm/ws lookup tables (892×482) + the 4 derived scalars are bit-exact CONSTANTS
  (max|Δ|=1.7e-18 / 0 vs the C init dump) — build once (`lru_cache` on `cfg`, host numpy → jnp
  constant, no grad through the table).** The `pow(·,1/3|1/4|1/2)` base is positive in every KEPT
  branch lane (verified analytically: `conas·u³−concs·zehat ≥ 70·|zehat|` when `zeta≤zetas`;
  `conam·u³−concm·zehat>0` for `zehat<0`; `1−conc2·zeta`/`1−conc3·zeta>0` since `zeta<0`), so
  `np.power(np.maximum(base,0), …)` only suppresses NaN in DISCARDED `np.where` lanes ⇒ the clamp is
  exact. (`kpp.build_wscale_tables`, `fesom_kpp.c:140-165`, K.1.)

- **[kpp/⚠️BUG] `wscale`'s bilinear `zfrac`/`ufrac` use the UNCLAMPED numerator minus the CLAMPED
  integer index (`fesom_kpp.c:184-191`) — so ustar beyond the table's `UMAX=0.04` EXTRAPOLATES
  LINEARLY (`ufrac>1`), it is NOT a clamped table edge.** I first clamped `uq=min(udiff/deltau,nnj)`
  and used `uq` for BOTH the index and the frac → at `ustar=0.05` got `vonk·0.04=0.0159` vs the C's
  `vonk·0.05=0.02`. The fix: `ju=trunc(min(uq_raw,nnj))` (clamped index) but `ufrac=uq_raw−ju`
  (UNCLAMPED numerator). `zfrac` was already right (numerator `zq` never clamped; only `iz` is). The
  remaining table-region residual (4.3e-13) is this extrapolation amplifying the table's ~1e-15
  last-ULP by `ufrac≈121` (the C's libm class); the stable region (`zehat>0`) is EXACT (0.0). *Lesson:
  in a clamped table lookup, check whether the fractional weight uses the clamped or the raw
  coordinate — FESOM extrapolates, so the raw one. Strong wind drives ustar≈0.2 ≫ UMAX, so this
  extrapolation path is HOT, not a corner case.* (`kpp.wscale`, K.2.)

- **[kpp/ad] `wscale` AD is finite everywhere incl. the ustar=0 zero-wind column: the `(int)` bin
  index is `jnp.trunc` (zero grad a.e. ⇒ discrete selection carries no cotangent), the bilinear
  weights stay differentiable ⇒ the gradient is the table's piecewise-linear slope; the stable-branch
  denom gets a `jnp.where`-safe dummy (`=1`) in the masked unstable lanes so the unused branch can't
  emit a `0·inf` masked-NaN.** Gated via the C `kpp_wscale_rank0.txt` sweep (201×101 over
  zehat∈[−1e-6,1e-6], ustar∈[0,0.05]) — spans table/stable/clamp/zero-wind. (`kpp.wscale`,
  `test_kpp_wscale.py`, K.2.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Tasks K.3 + K.4 — interior mixing + ddmix gate)

- **[kpp] `ri_iwmix` matches the C dump BIT-EXACTLY (max|Δ|=0 over 3.8M iface points) — but only
  because step-1 `uvnode=0` (cold start) ⇒ shear=0 ⇒ `frit∈{0,1}` (a pure `sign(N²)` map).** The
  shear=0 dump exercises the edge copies + masking + the static-instability (N²<0→frit=1) branch but
  NOT the intermediate cubic `frit=(1−min(Ri/Riinfty,1)²)³` ⇒ add a SYNTHETIC test (a linear
  u-profile sets a controlled shear, N² targets Ri across (0,Riinfty)) — matched 3e-18. The C's
  two-pass scratch (pass-1 Ri edge copies are FULLY overwritten by pass-2 viscA/diffK edge copies,
  since pass 2 reads only the interior Ri) collapses to a single edge-copy-of-the-result
  (`take_along_axis` with `clip(k, nzmin+1, nzmax-1)`). `diffKt is diffKs` (the `Kv0_const` branch ⇒
  one array for both). Output range = `node_iface_mask` = `[nzmin,nzmax]` (KPP FILLS surface+bottom
  via edge copies, unlike PP which leaves them 0). (`kpp.ri_iwmix`, `fesom_kpp.c:219`, K.3.)

- **[kpp/ad] `ri_iwmix`'s `Ri=max(N²,0)/(shear+epsln)` epsln=1e-40 is forward-inert AND backward-safe
  in practice.** Any realistic shear `(Δu/Δz)²≫1e-40` so epsln never bites the forward; where
  `shear→0` the outcome is `frit∈{0,1}` with a CLAMPED (`min`) or ZERO (`max(N²,0)=0`) ratio whose
  `d(ratio)/d(Ri)=0` ⇒ no `1/epsln²` blow-up at the relevant lanes (and dry lanes have N²=0→Ri=0). The
  dz reciprocal is clamped `where(dz==0,1,dz)` (the surface k=0 + the bottom-pad duplicate, both
  masked) to kill the `1/0` Inf the `pp`/`eos` shear pattern would otherwise leave in discarded lanes.
  d/d(uvnode), d/d(bvfreq) finite. (`kpp.ri_iwmix`, K.3.)

- **[kpp] K.4 `ddmix` (double diffusion) + the nonlocal flux are GATE-ONLY for CORE2** —
  `assert_no_double_diffusion(cfg)` is a no-op (`double_diffusion=False`) and raises `NotImplementedError`
  if enabled (the C `#error` analog, `fesom_kpp.c:828-831`); `ghats` is *computed* in blmix (K.6) but
  `use_kpp_nonlclflx=False` ⇒ never wired into the tracer flux. (`kpp.assert_no_double_diffusion`, K.4.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Task K.5 — pre-step + dbsfc + bldepth, the highest-risk kernel)

- **[kpp/⭐] `bldepth` (the OBL bulk-Ri search, historically the buggiest KPP kernel) VECTORIZES
  cleanly + matched the C on the FIRST try: hbl 6.5e-12, kbl 0/126858 mismatches, bfsfc 8.6e-23,
  stable/caseA EXACT.** The key realization: `Rib_k[nz]` has NO inter-level dependence — each level is
  a pure function of its own forcing (bfsfc/zehat/ws/Vtsq/Ritop/dVsq at nz) — so the C's two
  sequential per-node loops become two **masked first-crossings** (`jnp.argmax` of a bool = first
  True): loop 1 `Rib_k>Ricr → kbl1` + interpolated hbl, loop 2 `|zbar|>hbl → kbl`. The only sequential
  quantity, `Rib_km1`, is the gather `Rib_k[kbl-1]` with a `Rib_k[nzmin]=0` SENTINEL so a first-level
  crossing recovers the C's `Rib_km1=0` init. (`kpp.bldepth`, `fesom_kpp.c:317`, K.5.)

- **[kpp/⚠️] The loop-1-end bfsfc (feeding the Ekman/Monin-Obukhov gate) = bfsfc at kbl1 in BOTH the
  crossed AND never-crossed cases — no case split needed.** In the never-crossed case the C's final
  sw-interp-to-hbl collapses to `sw_3d[nzmax]` (the interp fraction → 1 exactly when
  `hbl=|zbar[nzmax]|`), which equals the top-of-loop bfsfc at nzmax = bfsfc at kbl1 (kbl1=nzmax). So a
  single gather `Bo+coeff_sw·(sw_surf−sw_3d[kbl1])` reproduces it. The Ekman/MO clamp
  `max(min(hbl,hlimit),|zbar[1]|)` applies only where `bfsfc1>0 && nzmin==0` (stabilizing forcing). The
  final-loop bfsfc interp uses SIGNED zbar `(hbl+zbar_km1)/(zbar_km1−zbar_k)`. (`kpp.bldepth`, K.5.)

- **[kpp/ad] bldepth AD finite everywhere (d/d{dVsq,Bo,bvfreq,dbsfc,sw_3d}): stop_gradient the integer
  kbl1/kbl, keep the hbl interp weight `(Ricr−Rib_prev)/(Rib_at−Rib_prev+ε)` differentiable, `_heaviside`
  = `0.5+copysign(0.5,x)` for stable/caseA (zero-grad regime switch), `_safe_sqrt(|bvfreq|)` in Vtsq.**
  Gradients are large (d/dBo ~1e10 — the hbl interp + `hmonob/(bfsfc+ε)` amplify) but FINITE; the
  masked-NaN gate K.10 confirms end-to-end. (`kpp.bldepth`, K.5.)

- **[kpp/⚠️] `ustar = sqrt( sqrt(τx²+τy²) / ρ0 )` is TWO nested sqrts, BOTH hitting 0 at zero wind
  (inner `sqrt(τ²)`, outer `sqrt(·/ρ0)`) ⇒ BOTH need `_safe_sqrt`.** The plan's "`sqrt(sqrt(|τ|/ρ0))`"
  notation is loose — it is the standard `sqrt(|τ_vec|/ρ0)` with `|τ_vec|=sqrt(τx²+τy²)` (exponent 0.5
  on the magnitude, NOT 0.25 — a test-math trap I hit). d/d(stress) at τ=0 finite (the #1 AD priority —
  ustar is in many downstream u*³/u*⁴ denominators). `dVsq=0` at the cold-start step 1 (uv=0; dump
  ~2e-30). (`kpp.prestep`, `fesom_kpp.c:792-821`, K.5.)

- **[kpp/eos] `dbsfc = −g·(ρ_surf(z)−ρ_insitu(z))/ρ_insitu(z)` (the surface parcel brought adiabatically
  to z vs in-situ) is AD-clean (ρ_insitu≈1030 ⇒ no singular denom, unlike bvfreq's 1/Δz) and bit-exact
  (max|Δ|=0) vs the C dump.** Gated via the GM dump's step-1 T/S — the SAME PHC IC (the EOS runs on the
  pre-mixing state, so the mixing scheme is irrelevant; GM-dump=PP, KPP-dump=KPP, identical step-1 T/S).
  `dbsfc[surface]=0` automatic (surface parcel at its own depth). Added to `eos.py` (only KPP reads it —
  PP skipped it, hence absent until now). **Extended the C KPP dump (jax-mesh-export) with `sw_3d` +
  `sw_alpha`** (bldepth reads them live — not previously dumped) so the controlled-replay has ALL its
  inputs; surgical C edit + rebuild + rerun (1 min). (`eos.compute_dbsfc`, `fesom_eos.c:138`,
  `jax_kpp_dump_core2.sh`, K.5.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Task K.6 — blmix, the C's hardest replay)

- **[kpp] `blmix` vectorizes as "per-node scalars → cubic-over-interfaces" and matched the C's hardest
  replay: blmc 1.9–3.0e-13 (the C hit 3.18e-13), dkm1 2.6e-14.** Per node (via gathers at the discrete
  matching level): `kn = min(kbl − int(caseA), nzmax-1)` (stop-grad), the one-sided slope
  `½(dvdz+|dvdz|) = max(dvdz,0)` (AD-safe kink), `gat1=visch/(hbl+ε)/(w+ε)`, `dat1=min(−slope/(w+ε)+f1·visch,
  0)` with `f1=stable·conc1·bfsfc/(u*⁴+ε)`. Then the cubic `blmc = hbl·w·sig·(1+sig·G)`, `G=a1+a2·gat1+a3·dat1`,
  over the BL interfaces `nz∈[nzmin+1, min(kbl-1,nzmax-1)]` (a masked range). Channel cross-wiring:
  blmcM←dcol ch0 (viscA)/wm, blmcT←dcol ch1 (diffKt)/ws, blmcS←dcol ch2 (diffKs)/ws. `dcol` = the
  ri_iwmix outputs directly (their nzmax edge-copy already gives `dcol[nzmax]=dcol[nzmax-1]`); `hnode`
  is passed in (a State field, static full-cell linfs ⇒ the GM dump's hnode for the replay). `dkm1` at
  kbl-1 uses σ from zbar (not Z). (`kpp.blmix`, `fesom_kpp.c:449`, K.6.)

- **[kpp/⚠️verify] `ghats` has the GM huge-dynamic-range signature — gate RELATIVE.** `ghats =
  (1−stable)·cg/(ws·hbl+ε)` reaches ~2e3 where the velocity scale `ws→0`, so its absolute residual
  (7.5e-11) carries that magnitude × FMA noise = relative ~3.7e-14 (bit-faithful). Gate
  `|Δ|≤atol+rtol·|ref|` (the `test_gm_slopes` neutral-slope pattern), not absolute. `ghats` is
  COMPUTED but CORE2 zeroes it outside the BL in the combine and never wires it into the tracer flux
  (`use_kpp_nonlclflx=False`). AD finite through all of blmix. (`test_kpp_blmix.py`, K.6.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Task K.7 — enhance + smooth_blmc + combine + node→elem)

- **[kpp] The KPP driver tail is BIT-EXACT (viscA/viscAE 2.2e-16, diffKt/diffKs 6.7e-16, ghats 0.0) —
  better than the scatter-class ~1e-12.** `enhance` modifies blmc at the SINGLE interface kbl-1 per
  node (a masked `where(k==kbl-1, blend, blmc)` update; `delta=(hbl+zbar[kbl-1])/(zbar[kbl-1]−zbar[kbl])`,
  blend = `om·interior + delta·(om²·dkm1 + delta²·dkmp5)`, `dkmp5=caseA·interior+(1−caseA)·blmc`) and
  scales ghats[kbl-1] by (1−caseA). `smooth_blmc` = `eos.smooth_nod3D(channel, 3)` — the SAME
  N²-smoother, 3 sweeps. `combine` = `max(interior_ri, smoothed_blmc)` within the BL (nz<kbl), ghats=0
  below; `Av` = 3-vertex node→elem mean + bottom-fill + `minmix` floor; `Kv = diffKt` (T-channel, both
  T&S in CORE2). The bit-exactness comes from the combine's `max` picking the deterministic interior in
  most lanes + the smoother reassociating identically single-rank. AD finite. **K.1→K.7 = the complete
  KPP forward chain, all controlled-replay bit-faithful + AD-finite.** (`kpp.enhance`/`assemble_mixing`,
  `fesom_kpp.c:588-924`, `test_kpp_enhance.py`, K.7.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Task K.8 — wire KPP into the assembled step)

- **[kpp/🎯headline] The wired KPP step is BIT-FAITHFUL to the C, not the "sanity match" the plan
  expected — because the ~52 % step-1 forcing transient is a *C↔Fortran* artifact, and the JAX forcing
  is a validated 1:1 port of the *C* forcing (Phase 5).** Running one assembled JAX KPP CORE2 step
  (PHC IC + JRA55 1958, KPP/GM-off/ice-off, dt=500) vs the C dumps: stress_node_surf 4.4e-16, Kv/Av @
  probes (post-mo_convect) 1.7e-21/0.0, all-nodes pre-mo_convect diffKt/viscA/viscAE 2.7–4.2e-12,
  hbl/ustar all-nodes 9.5e-9/6.0e-17. **Lesson:** before assuming a documented forcing-transient diff
  applies, check WHOSE forcing the reference used — a per-kernel replay isolates algebra from forcing,
  but here the *driver-level* gate is ALSO bit-faithful because both sides share the (ported) forcing.
  Don't pre-loosen a gate on a borrowed caveat. (`test_kpp_step.py`, K.8.)

- **[kpp/⚠️seam] The stress KPP reads for `ustar` is the ICE-BLENDED node stress, not the raw bulk
  stress — and `oce_fluxes_mom` runs even with ice dynamics OFF.** `forcing->stress_node_surf` is
  written by `fesom_bulk_compute` (raw) then OVERWRITTEN in place by `fesom_ice_oce_fluxes_mom`
  (blended: `sic·a_ice + atm·(1−a_ice)`, `fesom_ice_coupling.c:230-252`), which `fesom_main.c:1073-1075`
  calls unconditionally (only `FESOM_NO_WIND` skips it). The dump used the static-ice mask (a_ice=0.9
  where IC SST<0, u_ice=0), so the blend is active at cold nodes. The JAX `compute_surface_fluxes`
  already computed this blend (`sns_b`) for the element `stress_surf` but only exported the element
  mean — K.8 exports the node `sns_b` as `SurfaceFluxes.stress_node_surf` (and `ice_oce_fluxes_mom`
  now returns `(stress_surf, sns)`, threaded through `IceStepOut`). Verified vs the C `iceforce` dump
  (cols 8–9 = the final blended `stress_node_surf`) at 4.4e-16. (`core2_forcing.py`, `ice_step.py`,
  `ice_coupling.py`, K.8.)

- **[kpp] `mixing_kpp` mirrors `pp.mixing_pp`'s contract — `(Kv,Av,uvnode)` post-mo_convect — so KPP is
  a one-line drop-in at the step seam.** The C does compute_vel_nodes + (PP|KPP) + shared `mo_convect`
  in the step driver (`fesom_step.c:251-264`); the JAX `mixing_pp` already bundled compute_vel_nodes +
  mo_convect, so `mixing_kpp` does too (it imports `pp` for both — no cycle: pp has no kpp dep). The
  `DUMP_SUB_MIXING=4` probe is POST-mo_convect, so bundling mo_convect keeps the gate honest. KPP is a
  CORE2 forced-path feature → it **raises** on the pi path (no `step_forcing` ⇒ no heat/water/stress);
  the raise is at trace time (`kpp_cfg` is static) so it's clean. `kpp_cfg=None` ⇒ the PP branch is a
  dead `if` (no trace) ⇒ byte-identical. (`kpp.mixing_kpp`, `step.py` substep 4, K.8.)

- **[kpp/ad] The assembled-driver backward (`d/dT` through all of `mixing_kpp`) is finite + nonzero and
  runs in ~24 s on the LOGIN node** — the per-kernel safe-sqrt/stop-grad/physical-floor treatments
  compose cleanly through the full chain incl. compute_vel_nodes (element→node scatter), smooth_nod3D,
  and mo_convect. A single-kernel backward is light (unlike the full multi-step CORE2 trajectory
  backward, which RAM-thrashes the login node) — so a driver-level AD smoke fits in the suite; the
  full assembled-STEP masked-NaN grad gate is K.10 (SLURM). T enters via N²/dbsfc/α/β.
  (`test_kpp_step.py`, K.8.)

- **[kpp/⚠️jax-trap] `@lru_cache` returning *jnp* arrays leaks tracers across jit traces — cache the
  numpy build, cast to jnp FRESH per call.** `build_wscale_tables` was `@lru_cache` and returned
  `jnp.asarray(wmt), jnp.asarray(wst)`. The FIRST `step_jit` trace (is_first_step=True) called it,
  creating trace-bound `DynamicJaxprTracer`s that the cache stored; the SECOND trace (is_first_step=
  False, or the eager step-1 vs the `lax.scan` body in `integrate`) reused those cached arrays →
  `UnexpectedTracerError: a reference to an intermediate value ... escaped the scope`. The fix: split
  into `_build_wscale_tables_np` (`@lru_cache`, returns **numpy** — trace-independent) + a thin
  uncached `build_wscale_tables` wrapper doing `jnp.asarray` (each trace bakes its OWN constant; the
  expensive host build stays cached, only the cheap host→device cast repeats). **Why it hid through
  K.1–K.8:** the kernel tests + the K.8 step test all ran a SINGLE eager trace (no cross-trace reuse);
  the bug is jit/scan-trace specific and only the K.9 multi-step `step_jit` run (is_first_step True→
  False) first surfaced it. **Lesson:** a one-step forward gate is necessary but not sufficient — add
  a 2-step *jitted* smoke (both `is_first_step` variants) to exercise the second trace, and never
  cache device arrays keyed on a static config. (`kpp.build_wscale_tables`,
  `test_kpp_step.py::test_kpp_two_jitted_steps_no_leak`, K.8/K.9.)

## Phase 6C — KPP (Tasks K.9 + K.10 — climate/stability + the gradient gate → GATE 6C)

- **[kpp] The end-to-end "JAX-KPP ≈ C-KPP" claim lives at the STEP level (K.8, 1e-12), NOT a multi-day
  field diff — the multi-day gate is stability + the distinct-from-PP scheme signal.** KPP+GM+ice ran
  10 days stable (worst |vel|=1.885 m/s, SST capped −1.91 °C, ice bounded) AND a matched PP+GM+ice
  baseline gave a surface SST/SSS RMS of 0.129 °C / 0.063 psu vs the KPP run — the genuine scheme
  difference (~the C-class C-PP-vs-KPP 0.085 °C). So the discriminating chain is **JAX-KPP ≈ C-KPP
  (1e-12, the bit-faithful step) ≪ JAX-PP↔KPP gap (0.13 °C)** — ~11 orders of separation. A multi-day
  *field* comparison to the C diverges by FP chaos regardless of correctness (the Task-5.8 finding), so
  don't gate on it; gate on the step-level fidelity + the physical scheme signal. (`core2_kpp_stability_run.py`,
  K.9.)

- **[kpp/ad] The masked-NaN `d(mean SST)/d(T0)` through the ASSEMBLED multi-step KPP model is clean
  (non-finite=0, masked max|g|=0.0, wet 7e-5) — the kink-heaviest scheme survives the assembled
  backward.** The per-kernel AD treatments (safe-sqrt ustar/Vtsq, stop-grad kbl + differentiable hbl
  interp, f1/gat1/dat1 physical floors, the smooth_blmc/node→elem linear ops) compose through the
  4-step checkpointed scan backward at CORE2 scale (28 GB peak on the A100, 44 %). Do NOT require a
  smooth plateau through the discrete kbl — the bar is finite-everywhere + a well-conditioned gradient
  where one physically exists. (`core2_kpp_grad_gate.py` [3], K.10.)

- **[kpp/ad] A static-NamedTuple config field can still be a gradient target — `cfg._replace(field=
  traced)` traces it through any kernel that reads `cfg.field` directly (no hashing).** The KPP-tunable
  gradient `d(mean Kv)/d(K_bg)` = +0.9952 (additive interior diffusivity ⇒ FD plateau 1.1e-11) was
  taken by replacing the one `KppConfig` field with a traced scalar and running the mixing chain with
  the wscale tables PREBUILT from the static cfg (the only consumer that hashes cfg is the lru_cache'd
  table build — keep it on the static cfg). This is the Phase-7a pattern preview: KPP's `Ricr`/
  `visc_sh_limit`/backgrounds become tuning targets by lifting them from the static `KppConfig` into the
  traced `Params`. (`core2_kpp_grad_gate.py` [Kbg], K.10.)

## Sea-ice climate bias (Phase 6 follow-up — first real multi-year climate comparison)

- **[🎯big] Step-level bit-faithfulness does NOT guarantee a matching multi-year CLIMATE — run the
  end-to-end comparison.** Every gate through GATE 6C was step-level/per-kernel (controlled replay,
  step-1 bit-faithful). The FIRST annual-mean comparison vs the C-port-KPP + Fortran-KPP refs (via
  `m32_climate_compare.py`) found JAX-vs-C SST **0.49 °C RMS / −0.15 °C bias** vs the **0.005–0.014 °C**
  inter-reference budget (C-vs-Fortran, Kokkos-CUDA-vs-C) — a ~35–100× excess. **Lesson:** add a climate
  comparison to the acceptance gate; "≈ C at step 1" ≠ "≈ C climate". The C/Fortran/CUDA references
  agree to ~0.01 °C, so that IS the achievable bar — a from-scratch vectorized port is NOT exempt.
  (`core2_kpp_climate_run.py`, `kpp_bias_map.py`.)

- **[ice/diagnostic] The bias localized cleanly: high-lat marginal sea-ice only; open ocean
  (−45..+45°) matches C to the bit-faithful 0.006–0.024 °C ⇒ KPP/dynamics/open-ocean-forcing are
  SOUND.** Surface-trapped (gone by 200 m), in the seasonal-ice seas (Okhotsk/Bering). The fingerprint:
  `m_ice` **flips sign by hemisphere** (Arctic too thin −0.15 m, Antarctic too thick +0.27 m) while
  `a_ice` is high at both poles. Opposite-sign-N/S ⇒ first suspect was a hemisphere-dependent term
  (Coriolis `∝sin lat` / metric `∝tan lat`), but the **entire EVP dynamics + `metric_factor` (max|Δ|=0
  vs `tan(rot_lat)/R`) + Coriolis are bit-faithful to C** — RULED OUT. So it's THERMO/FORCING acting on
  two regimes (perennial vs seasonal ice). **Lesson:** opposite-N/S is a strong localizer; spatial +
  lat-band maps (`kpp_bias_map.py`) beat global RMS for diagnosis. (Investigation plan
  `docs/plans/20260607-fesom-jax-seaice-climate-bias.md`.)

- **[⚠️blind-spot] Cold-start step-1 gates can't see velocity/shear-dependent bugs.** At step 1
  `uv=u_ice=0` ⇒ shear/`dVsq`/strain = 0, so KPP shear-Ri, the EVP metric terms (`mfac·v̄` etc.), and
  any drift-dependent path are multiplied by zero and pass trivially. The EVP `metric_factor` value was
  only exercised *within* step 1's 120 subcycles (u builds up) — but a thermo/forcing offset that needs
  the spun-up circulation stays invisible for months. **Add a later-step (nonzero-velocity) dump-gate
  and a climate comparison.** (Phase 6/6C gates, the sea-ice bias.)

## Sea-ice climate bias — ROOT CAUSE (2026-06-07): `ice_dt` desynced from the ocean `dt`

- **[🎯ROOT-CAUSE] The high-lat sea-ice climate bias was NOT a kernel port bug — it was a CONFIG
  desync: the climate run stepped the ocean at `dt=1800` but built `IceConfig()` with the default
  `ice_dt=500`, so the ENTIRE ice subsystem integrated 3.6× too slowly.** `IceConfig.ice_dt`
  defaults to 500 (a build-time placeholder the docstring says to override per-run); the C
  `fesom_ice_setup` instead DERIVES it (`ice_dt = ice_ave_steps*dt`, `fesom_ice.c:231`). With the
  desync, every ice rate is wrong at once: thermo growth/melt (`rhow*ice_dt`, `o2ihf*ice_dt/cl`),
  FCT transport (`vol*ice_dt*…` in `_tg_rhs`), and EVP timing (`dte=ice_dt/120`, `Tevp_inv=3/ice_dt`).
  The ice "clock" ran at 500/1800 = 0.28× real time ⇒ sluggish, under-evolved ice. **Fix:**
  `cfg = cfg._replace(ice_dt=cfg.ice_ave_steps*dt)` at the top of `ice_surface_step` — derive it from
  the ocean `dt` so the desync is structurally impossible (`ice_step.py`). **VERIFIED (re-run, 1958):
  SST RMS 0.490→0.0107 °C (46×), m_ice RMS 0.196→0.0030, polar bands 0.71–0.77→0.009–0.017 — now
  INSIDE the 0.005–0.014 °C inter-reference budget at all latitudes. The whole high-lat bias was this
  one config line.**

- **[⚠️why-masked] The bug hid through ALL of Phase 6/6B/6C because every gate ran at `dt=500`,
  where `ice_dt=500` is COINCIDENTALLY correct.** The step dump gates (`test_ice_step`/`test_kpp_step`,
  `DT=500`), the kernel dumps (the C dump runs used dt=500), and EVERY stability/grad script
  (`core2_{ice,gm,kpp}_stability_run`, `core2_ice_grad_gate` — all `DT=500.0`) sat exactly on the one
  timestep where the default is right. The `dt=1800` climate run (the Fortran-KPP timestep) was the
  FIRST thing to run the ice off its default ⇒ the first to expose it. **Lesson: a config field with a
  default that is only valid for ONE value of another field is a latent footgun — gate at ≥2 distinct
  values of the coupling field (here dt), or derive the dependent field so it can't desync.** The
  `_replace` fix is a no-op at dt=500 (so all 55 ice/step tests stay green) and only bites at dt≠500.

- **[ice/fingerprint→cause] The opposite-sign-N/S `m_ice` fingerprint is explained by sluggish ice
  relaxing toward an IC seeded with the OPPOSITE asymmetry from equilibrium.** The cold-start IC
  (`fesom_ice.c:246-280`, `ice.ice_initial_state`) seeds SH `m_ice=2.0` THICKER than NH `m_ice=1.0`;
  the true (C) 2-yr climate is the reverse — NH 1.06 > SH 0.89. A 3.6×-too-slow ice is pulled toward
  the IC ⇒ too THIN in the NH (1.0→0.91 vs C 1.06) and too THICK in the SH (2.0→1.15 vs C 0.89) =
  the observed opposite sign; the retained concentration ⇒ `a_ice` high at BOTH poles ⇒ cold
  surface-trapped SST in the marginal-ice seas. **Lesson: "opposite-sign by hemisphere" need not be a
  hemisphere-dependent TERM — it can be a uniform rate error acting on an asymmetric IC.** This is
  why the metric/Coriolis hunt (`∝sin lat`/`∝tan lat`) was the wrong tree: those were bit-faithful;
  the asymmetry lived in the IC, not the physics. (Investigation plan §0/§1.)

- **[audit/method] Ruling out EVERY kernel is what forced the search up to the config/threading
  level — the negative result was the signal.** A full static re-audit (this session) confirmed
  `ice_thermo`↔`fesom_ice_thermo.c`, the FCT `ice_adv`↔`fesom_ice_fct.c` (TG-RHS, the `_mm_times`
  CSR-mass reconstruction, low/high-order solves, the full Zalesak limiter), the EVP `evp_setup`
  (`ice_strength` incl. the load-bearing `0.5`, `inv_mass`, `inv_areamass`), `ice_coupling`
  (`ocean2ice`/`ice_oce_fluxes`/`_mom`), and `atm_ice_stress`/bulk are ALL faithful, AND every
  `IceConfig` constant matches `fesom_ice.c:53-111` (incl. `h0=h0_s=0.5` ⇒ `lid_clo` is NOT
  hemisphere-split). When the kernels are all faithful and a systematic bias remains, the bug is in
  the WIRING (what dt/state each kernel is fed), not the algebra. (Sea-ice bias investigation.)

- **[ice/threading] Minor (NOT the bias): JAX's `srfoce_u/v` is one extra step lagged vs the C.**
  `ocean2ice` reads the carried `state.uvnode[:,0]`, which substep-4 computed from the PREVIOUS
  step's input `uv`; the C `fesom_ocean2ice` recomputes the area-weighted node velocity fresh from
  the current `dyn->uv`. So the ice sees `uv_out(N-2)` where the C sees `uv_out(N-1)` — a ~30-min lag
  at dt=1800. `compute_vel_nodes` IS the C's exact area-weighted incident-surface-element recipe, so
  the only diff is the lag, not the recipe. Left as-is (sub-dominant); revisit if a residual remains
  after the `ice_dt` fix. (`ice_coupling.ocean2ice`, `step.py` uvnode threading.)

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.1 — the `dist_<NP>` partition reader)

- **[🎯ownership-asymmetry] Only NODES are uniquely partitioned; ELEMENTS and EDGES are redundantly
  owned at partition boundaries.** Verified on CORE2 `dist_2`: `Σ_d myDim_nod2D == nod2D` exactly
  (126858, interior lists disjoint), but `Σ_d myDim_elem2D = 245221 > elem2D = 244659` (overlap 562)
  and `Σ_d myDim_edge2D = 372225 > 371644` (overlap 581). A boundary element whose 3 vertices span
  two ranks sits in the **interior** (`myDim`, not the halo) of *both* ranks — that IS the "redundant
  compute over the halo" model (both ranks compute it; the broadcast then only needs to refresh the
  outer halo). **Load-bearing for S.5:** a reduction over elements/edges must assign each shared
  entity a UNIQUE owner (e.g. lowest-rank, or a precomputed owner flag) — naively summing over
  `myDim` double-counts the boundary. Node reductions (CG dots, `integrate_nod_2D`) are safe. The
  global counts are therefore `max(gid)+1` (the id space is dense `[0,count)`), NOT `Σ myDim`.

- **[index-conventions] `dist_<NP>` is 1-based Fortran; shift to 0-based — but NOT every field.**
  Confirmed by reading how `fesom_halo.c` consumes each: `rPE`/`sPE` are MPI **rank** ids fed
  straight to `MPI_Isend`/`MPI_Irecv` (`:166,182`) ⇒ already 0-based, **no shift**; `rlist`/`slist`
  are LOCAL field indices used as `[...]-1` (`:178,196`) ⇒ shift; `rptr`/`sptr` are 1-based cumulative
  offsets (`rptr[0]==1`) ⇒ shift so `rptr[0]==0` and `rlist[rptr[k]:rptr[k+1]]` slices cleanly;
  `myList_*` are 1-based gids ⇒ shift. After the shift: `rlist` ∈ `[myDim, myDim+eDim)` (the halo
  lanes a rank receives into), `slist` ∈ `[0, myDim)` (the interior lanes it sends). Getting the
  rPE/sPE shift wrong (subtracting 1 from a rank id) is a silent off-by-one that only surfaces as a
  wrong neighbour at exchange time — read the *consumer* (`fesom_halo.c`), not just the file, to know
  which fields are indices vs ids.

- **[reader-design] Mirror `fscanf(" %d")` with a tokenise-once `_IntStream`, not `np.loadtxt`.**
  `rpart.out`/`my_list`/`com_info` are free-format (whitespace == newline, ragged rows), and the C
  reads a known *count* of ints per block then stops — `np.loadtxt` (regular columns) can't model
  that, but `f.read().split()` + a cursor + `np.array(tok[i:i+n], int32)` does, and the slice-parse
  keeps even the 63k-entry `myList` blocks to one numpy call. `rpart.out` actually holds
  `npes + npes counts + nod2D owner-ids`; the C reads only the first `1+npes` (builds the vestigial
  `part[]` prefix, never indexed downstream) and ignores the per-node owner vector — mirror that.

- **[pytree-ragged] A registered-pytree dataclass can hold ragged per-rank data as `tuple`-of-arrays.**
  `Partition` is read for all `npes` ranks in one process (vs the C's per-rank `mype`), so per-rank
  `myList`/`com` are ragged. Storing them as `npes`-long tuples of numpy arrays (counts as rectangular
  `[npes]` arrays) flattens cleanly: `tree_flatten` recurses into the tuples and the nested (also
  registered) `ComStruct`, yielding all arrays as leaves, with the global scalar counts as static
  meta. It is **host metadata** (consumed by S.2's numpy build), never device-put — registering it is
  house-style + lets `tree_map` work, not a correctness need. The serial `npes==1` `synth_serial`
  (identity `myList=arange`, empty coms) makes the sharded path reduce to the dense model.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.2 — sharded-mesh build + export)

- **[exchange-as-gather] For the gate, the broadcast exchange is an `all_gather` + per-lane gather,
  encoded as `(src_dev, src_lane)` `[P,Lmax]` per kind — no `slist`/`rlist` segment bookkeeping.**
  A halo lane reads its owner's *interior* value; an **interior lane reads itself (identity)** — that
  is exactly the C broadcast (owner→halo overwrite, interior untouched). Built from a `_owner_map`
  (global id → lowest-id interior owner + that owner's interior lane), NOT from the `com_struct`:
  halo lanes are *by construction* `[myDim:myDim+eDim)` (FESOM's `myList` order), so `rlist` only
  *reorders* them by neighbour — irrelevant to a gather that refreshes every halo lane from its owner.
  Verified gid-consistent on dist_4 (every halo lane's owner gid == the lane's gid; halo never
  self-owned). `ragged_all_to_all` (the scalable form that *does* need the segments) is a perf
  follow-up; the `com_struct` stays in `Partition` for it.

- **[interior-identity] Never refresh interior lanes — only halo.** Elements/edges are redundantly
  owned (S.1), so a boundary element is interior on ≥2 devices; each computes it independently
  (~1e-15 apart from FP reassociation). Refreshing interior from a canonical owner would impose one
  device's value on the others — a deviation from the C (which leaves them independent). The
  identity-on-interior rule keeps the N-vs-1 gate clean: each device's owned copy = its own compute =
  the 1-device value to ~1e-12. Halo source choice among redundant interior owners is immaterial
  (same value to ~1e-15).

- **[omit-CSR] `nod_in_elem2D` (the node→elem CSR) is used ONLY by the host PHC IC builder
  (`phc_ic.py`), never a step kernel** (grep-confirmed) — so it is **omitted** from the per-device
  bundle. S.2b builds the IC on the host then partitions the result, so the ragged-CSR pad (the one
  genuinely awkward field to shard) is never needed. Audit "who reads this field" before paying to
  shard it.

- **[pad-for-AD] Pad value by dtype: float→`1.0`, int→`0`, connectivity→`-1`, bool→`False`.**
  Floats pad to **nonzero** (1.0) not 0 so a masked pad lane that feeds a denominator (`1/area`,
  `1/elem_area`) stays finite — the masked-NaN AD rule, now on the device-pad axis. The gathered masks
  are `False` on pad lanes, so a padded "entity" is fully masked regardless; the pad value only
  matters for finiteness of unmasked intermediates. Connectivity pads `-1` (the existing boundary
  sentinel); owned elements carry **no** `-1` (their 3 vertices are all local — 0 sentinels in
  `elem_nodes[:myDim]` on dist_4), so no owned output depends on a sentinel gather (S.2's safety
  proof). Only halo/eXDim lanes carry `-1`, and those are masked / refreshed.

- **[noop-invariant] The `npes==1` sharded mesh is array-equal to the dense `Mesh`** (all non-static,
  non-CSR fields, squeezing the `P=1` axis) — the additive-sharding guarantee. `g2l` is the identity
  `arange` at `npes==1`, so connectivity remap is a no-op; replicated `zbar`/`Z` are kept global.
  This test is the cheap proof that the single-device path is structurally untouched.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.2b — partition State / forcing / IC)

- **[same-Lmax] State and mesh MUST pad to the same `Lmax`** — factor a single `local_sizes(partition)`
  used by both `build_sharded_mesh` and `partition_state`. Then the state's pad lanes `[n_local:Lmax]`
  coincide exactly with the mesh's invalid (mask-`False`) lanes ⇒ the padded state is provably inert
  (masked out of every owned computation). If the two derived `Lmax` independently they could drift and
  a "padded" state lane could land on a *valid* mesh lane — a silent corruption. One source of truth.

- **[detect-leading-dim] Shard a pytree field by DETECTING its entity axis (size == nod2D / elem2D),
  not a hardcoded node/elem list.** `State`'s 40 fields are node- or elem-leading; `StepForcing` is
  `[nod2D]` for one step but `[n_steps, nod2D]` when scanned. A size-match finds the node axis in both
  (the `n_steps`-vs-`nod2D` sizes never collide), so one `_shard_along_axis(arr, ml, Lmax, axis)`
  handles single + stacked + node + elem uniformly and survives a field-list change.

- **[host-IC] Build the IC globally on the host, then `partition_state` — do NOT port a distributed IC.**
  `State.rest` / PHC IC / ice cold-start all already produce a *global* `State`; gathering it to
  per-device padded form is a pure reshape. This **sidesteps the C's PHC `extrap_nod3D` per-sweep halo
  exchange** (a startup cost the C pays because it builds the IC already-distributed) — the same
  host-build trick used for the SSH operator. The serial-`npes==1` `partition_state` is array-equal to
  the dense `State` (the no-op invariant), so the single-device IC path is untouched.

- **[forcing-pytrees] `ForcingStatic`/`StepForcing` are `NamedTuple`s ⇒ already JAX pytrees** (no
  registration needed). Partition them field-by-field: node fields gather to `[P, Lmax_nod]`, the scalar
  `ocean_area` stays replicated (it becomes a `psum` over owned nodes in S.5), and a scanned stack
  `[n_steps, nod2D]` → `[P, n_steps, Lmax_nod]` (node axis sharded, `n_steps` preserved for the scan).

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.3 — broadcast halo-exchange primitive + identity gate)

- **[shard_map-convention] Fold the device axis INTO the leading dim — `[P*Lmax, …]` sharded
  `PartitionSpec('p')`, NOT `[P, Lmax, …]`.** `shard_map` keeps a sharded axis at its *local* size: a
  `[P, Lmax]` global with `P('p')` gives each device `[1, Lmax]` (a stray size-1 axis the body must
  squeeze everywhere). Reshaping to `[P*Lmax, …]` and sharding `P('p')` gives each device `[Lmax, …]`
  directly — so the step body (S.7) operates on the natural `[Lmax, …]` shape **unchanged**. The
  `(P, Lmax)`-stacked S.2 arrays just `.reshape(P*Lmax, …)` at device-placement.

- **[exchange=all_gather+gather] The broadcast exchange is `all_gather` then a per-lane gather** —
  `g = all_gather(field, 'p', axis=0); out = g[src_dev, src_lane]`. The fancy index on `g`'s leading
  two axes (`[P, Lmax]`) handles `[Lmax]`, `[Lmax,nl]`, `[Lmax,nl,2]` in one line (trailing axes ride
  along). Interior lanes are identity (`src_dev=self`, `src_lane=self`), halo lanes read their owner's
  interior — exactly the C `fesom_halo_exchange` (owner→halo overwrite, interior untouched). `src_lane`
  is always `≥0`, so the exchange gather NEVER hits a sentinel (no masked-NaN risk inside the
  collective). `all_gather` is the simplest verifiable collective and correct for 2–4 devices;
  `ragged_all_to_all` (the scalable form, needing the `com_struct` slist/rlist) is a perf follow-up.

- **[identity-gate] Ported `fesom_halo_identity_test`**: set owned lanes to their gid, halo to the
  sentinel, exchange, assert every halo lane now carries its owner's gid (+ corruption recovery — clobber
  a halo lane, re-exchange, restored). Passes for all 3 kinds (nod/elem/elem-full) × {2,4} devices and a
  multi-level field. The exchange is **linear** in `field` (gather is linear); its vjp is the reverse
  exchange (`all_gather` transpose = reduce-scatter `psum`, gather transpose = scatter-add → halo
  cotangents flow additively back to owners) — JAX handles it automatically; FD-grad-checked on interior
  AND halo lanes.

- **[fake-device-gate] Collective tests need ≥2 CPU fake-devices, set at process start
  (`XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=N`) BEFORE jax init** — so they `pytest.skip` in
  the default 1-device suite and run as a separate `run_suite.sbatch` SHARDING group (4 devices). The
  host-side foundation (`partit`/`shard_mesh`/`partition_state`) needs no fake-devices (pure numpy +
  pytrees) and stays in the ocean group. A 4-device process can test `dist_2` too (subset the mesh to
  `jax.devices()[:2]`).

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.4 — exchange schedule + scatter gate)

- **[🎯loop-bound-verified] The `PORTING_LESSONS §4` halo-bound rule HOLDS for the JAX sharding — a
  LOCAL scatter gives each OWNED entity its complete sum, no special loop bound.** Verified on dist_4:
  every owned node has ALL its incident edges AND incident elements in its local list, and every owned
  element has all its `edge_tri`-contributing edges local (0 violations). So a kernel run over a device's
  local (owned+halo) entities with the existing `segment_sum` produces, on **owned** entities, the SAME
  sum as the global single-device kernel (modulo FP reassociation ~1e-13). The post-kernel broadcast is
  needed ONLY to refresh the (incomplete) HALO copies for the next kernel — it does not fix owned values.
  Confirmed by the scatter gate: owned edge→node and edge→element scatters match the global to 1e-11
  *before* any broadcast; the broadcast then makes the halo match too. This is why the C "redundant
  compute over `myDim+eDim(+eXDim)` + broadcast" model is correct, and why no JAX kernel scatter needs a
  change for sharding — only the local connectivity (S.2) + the post-kernel exchange (S.7).

- **[schedule-as-data] The per-substep exchange schedule is a DATA module (`halo_points.py`), not inline
  code** — ported from the C `MPI_PORT_REPORT.md` "Halo exchanges per timestep" table (ocean, ~30
  exchanges) + the `fesom_exchange_nod2D` call sites in `fesom_ice_{evp,fct,coupling,thermo}.c`. Each
  `Exch` records (substep, field, kind, **post/intra**, C-ref). S.7 iterates the `post` ones as simple
  inserts; the `intra` ones need a kernel split (recorded in `FUSED_KERNELS_NEEDING_SPLIT`).

- **[intra-kernel-splits] FIVE fused JAX kernels exchange MID-kernel ⇒ must be split in S.7:**
  `momentum.visc_filt_bidiff` (the bilaplacian exchanges `u_b/v_b` then `u_c/v_c` mid-kernel),
  `tracer_adv.advect_one_fct` + the `ice_adv` FCT (Zalesak exchanges `fct_LO` then `plus/minus` around
  the limiter), `ssh._pcg` (CG exchanges `pp`/`rr` per iteration — S.6), and the **EVP subcycle**
  (`u_ice/v_ice` exchanged INSIDE the 120-step `lax.scan` — a collective *inside* `scan` under
  `shard_map`, which must lower/transpose). A fused 2nd stage that reads a halo-stale 1st stage gives an
  owned-node boundary error — the C's hardest surface; splitting exposes the seam.

- **[elem-full=superset] The `all_gather` exchange refreshes the FULL local elem extent
  (`eDim+eXDim`), so one `'elem'` map serves both the C's `elem2D` and `elem2D_full` exchanges.** A
  superset refresh is always correct for the N-vs-1 gate (no kernel relies on a *stale* halo); only the
  per-substep C-N dump diff (S.9c) would need the exact `eDim`-only intermediate, restricting the refresh
  to `[myDim:myDim+eDim]`.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.5 — distributed reductions)

- **[all-node-reductions] Every per-step reduction is NODE-based, so the S.1 element/edge
  redundant-ownership caveat does NOT bite the reductions.** `_area_mean` (virtual-salt / relax-salt /
  water-flux balances) and the CG dots are all sums over nodes; `ocean_area` is `Σ areasvol_surf` over
  nodes. Nodes are uniquely owned, so `owned_mask` (`i<myDim`) IS the unique-owner mask ⇒ owned-node sum
  + `psum` is exact. (`ice_coupling.ice_oce_fluxes` routes through `sss_runoff._area_mean` — there is one
  reduction primitive, not two.) If a future element/edge reduction appears, it would need the
  min-owner mask, not `owned_mask`.

- **[reduction-gating] `global_sum(vals, owned_mask, axis_name=None)` — `axis_name=None` ⇒ plain masked
  sum (single-device), a real `axis_name` ⇒ owned-sum + `jax.lax.psum`.** Routing `_area_mean` through it
  with `owned_mask=None` default keeps the `npes==1` graph the **exact** `jnp.sum(x·area)/ocean_area`
  (byte-identical — the 9 sss tests + the dead-branch discipline confirm); S.7 threads the real
  `owned_mask`/`axis_name` through the step's call chain. `psum` is only valid inside `shard_map` (it
  needs the mapped axis), so the `None` path is mandatory off the sharded path, not just an optimization.

- **[psum-out-spec] A `psum`'d scalar is replicated across devices ⇒ `shard_map` `out_specs=PartitionSpec()`
  (empty)** returns it directly (all devices hold the same total). 2/4-device owned-sum + `psum` matches
  the single-device global sum to ~1e-12 (reduction reassociation), and a deliberately-corrupted halo
  value leaves the result unchanged (masked) — the owned-mask correctness check.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.6 — distributed CG solve)

- **[🎯operator-loop-bound-by-VALUE] The SSH stiffness stencil EXCEEDS the node halo — but every excess
  owned-row entry is EXACTLY zero, so a local matvec is still exact on owned rows.** Unlike the S.4
  *scatter* loop-bound (which held topologically), the global `S`/`M⁻¹` operator has owned-row columns
  *outside* the local node list (11664 entries on dist_2, 20466 on dist_4). Keeping only
  (row-local ∧ col-local) entries would silently DROP them — but **all of them have exactly-zero stiffness
  AND preconditioner value** (the operator deliberately keeps the full topological pattern incl. numeric
  zeros, `fesom_ssh.c`; the far "wing" columns reached through eXDim-halo elements are all zeros, and the
  MITgcm precond is `∝ S[i,j]` so it is zero wherever `S` is). So `(S_local·x)[i] == (S·x)[i]` EXACTLY for
  owned `i` (the dropped terms are `0·x = 0`). `partition_ssh_operator` **asserts no NONZERO owned-row entry
  is dropped** — a mesh/config that ever violated it fails loudly instead of corrupting the owned matvec.
  Lesson: the operator analog of the loop-bound must be checked on VALUES, not just topology — "is the
  stencil inside the halo?" can be *no* and the scheme still correct because the overshoot is numeric zero.

- **[fold-exchange-into-matvec] Fold the halo exchange INTO `ssh_matvec`/`ssh_precond` ⇒ the `_pcg` body is
  structurally UNCHANGED (only the dots → `global_dot`, `n` → global count).** The C's per-iteration
  schedule ("exchange `pp` before each SpMV, `rr` after the residual update") maps EXACTLY: the matvec
  broadcast-exchanges its input (`pp`) before the local SpMV; the precond exchanges its input (`rr`) right
  before its SpMV — which is exactly *after* `r = r − α·Ap`. So the CG loop needs no per-step exchange
  plumbing: the matvec/precond closures carry the `SSHHalo`, and `custom_linear_solve`'s `matvec` refreshes
  the halo automatically every SpMV. The carry vectors' halo lanes are **scratch** (refreshed inside
  matvec/precond, never trusted); only OWNED lanes are the real state, masked into every dot. The dense
  path (`halo=None`) guards the exchange behind `if halo is not None` and the dots default to `jnp.sum`
  (`reduce=None`) ⇒ the **exact `v1.0` graph** (43 single-device ssh tests stay green, dump ~1e-18 + AD).

- **[🔴iteration-count-robust] CORE2 CG = 127 iters (cold) / 130 (warm) — NOT pi's ≈3 — yet the count is
  robustly device-deterministic, and `d_eta` matches to MACHINE PRECISION.** The `ssh.py` docstring's
  "≈3 iters, cond≈800" is **pi**; the real CORE2 operator (dt=1800, nod2D=126858) is far stiffer and the
  loose `soltol=1e-5` stop lands deep in the trajectory. Captured the residual-vs-threshold margin on the
  REAL KPP+GM+ice rhs (`scripts/capture_core2_ssh_rhs.py`): consecutive residuals near the stop cross the
  threshold by only a factor **~1.09** (tightest margin: the last *above* iterate sits 0.93 % above `rtol`)
  — but that is **~10 orders of magnitude** above the ~1e-15 `psum` reassociation, so the count CANNOT
  drift. Verified N==1 iteration count (127/130 on 2 and 4 devices) AND owned `d_eta` agreeing to
  **~3e-16 abs (1e-15 rel)** — far tighter than the 1e-12 budget, because (a) each owned row's local
  `segment_sum` is over the same nonzero terms in the same order (bit-identical per row) and (b) the
  contracting CG damps the ~1e-15 dot-reassociation. The residual RMS divides by the GLOBAL node count
  (`halo.n_global`), not `b.shape[0]` (= local `Lmax`) — getting that wrong would shift `rtol` per device.

- **[collective-in-while_loop-lowers] `all_gather` + `psum` inside a `lax.while_loop` inside
  `custom_linear_solve` inside `shard_map` LOWERS and runs (review #4 resolved).** The data-dependent CG
  trip count is safe because the `psum`'d residual is identical on every device (no deadlock — all devices
  exit the loop on the same iteration). `custom_linear_solve(symmetric=True)` reuses the (exchange+SpMV)
  matvec as its own transpose; that matvec represents the symmetric global `S` on owned lanes, so the
  implicit-diff cotangent (`S⁻¹·x̄` via the tight `transpose_solve`, also sharded) is structurally intact —
  the gradient is gated in S.8, *not* AD-through-the-`while_loop`. Confirmed on 4 CPU fake-devices (~54 s,
  9 tests) and an early real-4×A100 run (the formal multi-GPU gate is S.9).

- **[capture-realistic-rhs] Gate the distributed CG on a CAPTURED real-config rhs, not a synthetic one.**
  The iteration-count margin is a property of the operator (mesh+dt) AND the rhs spectrum (config), so the
  fixture is `ssh_rhs` read straight off `state.ssh_rhs` after a real assembled `step()` (KPP+GM+ice,
  dt=1800) — 2 steps give the cold-start (`x0=0`) and warm-start (`x0=d_eta_step1`) cases. Saved on `/work`
  (gitignored, ~1 MB each) like the dumps. The serial `npes==1` `partition_ssh_operator` is byte-equal to
  the dense operator (rows/cols/vals), and the serial sharded solve reproduces the dense `d_eta` — the
  no-op invariant proving the sharded code path collapses to the single-device model.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 1 — device-mesh placement + local reconstruction)

- **[reconstruct-local-mesh] Run the UNMODIFIED `step` under `shard_map` by reconstructing a per-device
  LOCAL `Mesh` with `Lmax` STATIC sizes.** The kernels use `mesh.nod2D`/`elem2D`/`edge2D` only as
  `segment_sum` `num_segments` / array-shape bounds (audited — `myDim_edge2D` is `build_ssh_operator`-only,
  not a step kernel), so setting the reconstructed mesh's static sizes to the LOCAL `Lmax` makes every
  scatter allocate `[Lmax]` and the kernels run on each device's shard with **zero code change**. The
  omitted node→elem CSR (`nod_in_elem2D`, S.2 — IC-only) is a step-unused dummy. Pass the `Mesh` to
  `shard_map` as a "folded" container — `Lmax` static meta + `[P*Lmax_kind, …]` leaves + a `Mesh`-shaped
  `PartitionSpec` tree (`'p'` for entity fields, `()` for replicated `zbar`/`Z` + the CSR dummy) — and
  inside the body it IS a valid local `Mesh`. `npes==1` reconstruction is array-equal to the dense `Mesh`
  for every step-read field ⇒ the whole step under `shard_map` is **byte-identical** to dense (`max|Δ|=0`).

- **[🎯check_vma-false] `shard_map(..., check_vma=False)` is REQUIRED to run the unmodified kernels.**
  JAX 0.10's `shard_map` tracks "varying manual axes": a value derived from a sharded input is typed
  `{V:p}`. The kernels' tridiagonal-solve (Thomas) and FCT `lax.scan`s init their carry with a CONSTANT
  `jnp.zeros` (NOT varying) while the body produces a varying carry → the strict check rejects the
  `float64[n]` vs `float64[n]{V:p}` carry-type mismatch ("manual axis types do not match"). `check_vma=False`
  treats every value conservatively as per-device-varying (always correct here — no cross-device replication
  to exploit inside a `shard_map` body), so the scans lower unchanged. ⚠️ Contrast S.6: the CG `while_loop`
  lowered with `check_vma=True` (default) because ALL its carries derive from the sharded `b` (uniformly
  varying). The constant-carry scan is the case that needs the relaxation — reach for it whenever an
  unmodified body has a `lax.scan`/`while_loop` seeded by a literal.

- **[interior-match-diagnostic] Without exchanges, the deep-interior owned nodes already match single
  device — a cheap proof the local kernels are correct on real shards.** On CORE2 `dist_2`, 58 % of owned
  nodes match the dense full-step `T` to 1e-10 with NO halo exchanges (their multi-substep stencil never
  reaches a halo lane); the boundary 42 % is the halo footprint the exchanges (rest of S.7) refresh. So a
  multi-device step that LOWERS + matches on the interior validates the placement + the per-shard kernel
  correctness independently of the exchange wiring — debug the plumbing before the boundary.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 2 — interleave the halo exchanges + split the fused kernels)

- **[🎯JAX-redundant-compute-needs-FEWER-exchanges-than-C] In the JAX sharding model the kernels run over
  the FULL local extent `[0,Lmax)`, so per-NODE intermediates are auto-complete on the halo — only SCATTER
  results need an exchange.** This is the key divergence from the C MPI port. The C computes per-node fields
  over OWNED entities only (`myDim`) and must EXCHANGE every intermediate a downstream kernel reads at the
  halo (e.g. it exchanges the raw `bvfreq` BEFORE `smooth_nod3D`). In JAX, a per-node field like raw `bvfreq`
  = f(T,S at the node) is computed for owned AND halo lanes (T/S halos are fresh), so it is already complete
  on the halo — **no pre-smooth exchange needed**. The exchanges that ARE needed are exactly where a kernel
  produces an incomplete-on-halo value (a SCATTER over edges/elements, whose halo entity's contributing
  edges aren't all local) and a LATER kernel reads it at the halo (a gather-to-element or a per-node
  cluster). So the C `§4` loop-bound rule ("who reads this into the halo?") still applies, but the
  "producing loop covers `myDim+eDim`" half is automatic — only the scatter-result exchanges remain.

- **[🎯use-the-Kokkos-SYNC_MAP] The reference ports' per-substep exchange map is the authoritative checklist
  — read it BEFORE wiring, not after debugging.** `port_kokkos/docs/SYNC_MAP.md` lists every substep's
  internal-exchange (`D21`) bracket. It caught two scatter-result exchanges the `MPI_PORT_REPORT` table folds
  into a kernel and I had missed: (1) `momentum_adv_scalar`'s node advection `un_u/un_v` (a scatter), gathered
  back to elements at the cell vertices — needs a `nod` exchange before the gather; (2) the FCT element tracer
  gradient `tr_xy` (wrong on eXDim halo elements), read by `fill_up_dn_grad` — needs an `elem` exchange. Both
  are the "scatter/incomplete value read at the halo" pattern. The per-field N-vs-1 diagnostic (diff every
  State field owned-and-halo) localizes a missing one in one run; the reference map prevents needing the run.

- **[🎯FCT-upwind-flip-is-climate-close-NOT-a-bug] The Zalesak FCT amplifies the ~1e-12 input reassociation to
  ~1e-3 on the tracer via UPWIND FLIPS — the documented "climate-close, not bit-identical" non-determinism,
  not a missing exchange.** After all exchanges were wired, the N-vs-1 step matched to <1e-9 on EVERY field
  except the FCT tracers (T,S) and the heavily-**cancelling** SSH divergences (`ssh_rhs`/`ssh_rhs_old`).
  Three independent proofs it is NOT a halo gap: (a) the per-field diagnostic showed ALL FCT *inputs*
  (`uv,w_e,helem,hnode,T_old`) match to 1e-9 on owned AND halo — a missing exchange would diverge an input's
  halo; (b) `S` (constant in the test ⇒ zero advection) matches to <1e-9 while `T` (with a gradient) does
  not — the error is advection-magnitude-dependent; (c) the owned and halo errors are EQUAL (a boundary
  exchange bug makes the halo worse). Mechanism: the upwind flux `±0.5(vflux±|vflux|)·Tmean` flips which face
  value it takes when `vflux` (the edge volume flux) crosses zero, and a 1e-12 reassociation near a zero-flux
  edge flips it ⇒ an O(1) flux swing. The C and Kokkos ports both accept this (`SCATTER_STRATEGY.md` D22:
  "Serial bit-identical, OpenMP/CUDA climate-close"). So the per-substep gate is **field-appropriate**:
  momentum/SSH/ALE/EOS to the clean reassociation floor (<1e-7, the proof the wiring is right), FCT tracers
  + cancellation fields to the flip/cancellation budget (scales DOWN with the velocity/gradient, so it is far
  smaller on a physical field than on a sharp test bump). This IS Phase 8's bar (Decision 4: per-substep
  correctness, not bit-identity — "the C port sees the same chaotic Allreduce-order divergence").

- **[exch-closure-gating] One `_exch(field, kind)` closure threads every exchange; `halo_ctx=None` ⇒ the
  identity ⇒ byte-identical `v1.0`.** `step` builds `_exch = halo_ctx.exchange` (sharded) or `lambda f,k: f`
  (dense), inserts `field = _exch(field, kind)` after each producing kernel (the `OCEAN_SCHEDULE` posts), and
  passes `exch=_exch` into the fused kernels that split (`visc_filt_bidiff` exch `Uc/Vc`; `momentum_adv_scalar`
  exch `un_u/un_v`; `advect_one_fct` exch `fct_LO`+`tr_xy`, `zalesak_limit` exch `fct_plus/minus`). The
  `None`→identity makes every insertion a structural no-op ⇒ the 483-test single-device suite stays GREEN
  (dump gates byte-identical). Over-exchanging is harmless (refreshing an unread halo is a no-op), so insert
  the WHOLE schedule and let the per-field N-vs-1 diagnostic flag any genuinely-missing one.

- **[⚠️compute-node-not-login] Run every multi-minute `shard_map` compile via `sbatch` on a COMPUTE node,
  NOT the login node.** The full assembled step under `shard_map` is a ~2 min compile + GBs of RAM; iterating
  it on the shared login node (`levante0`, ~40 users, RAM-limited, one-CPU-JAX-process) is antisocial and can
  be killed. Only the lightweight host-side numpy checks (stencil/connectivity audits) belong on login. The
  slower `sbatch` debug cycle (queue + run) is the correct cost; batch several diagnostics into one job.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 3 — GM/Redi forced-path exchanges)

- **[🎯GM-needs-5-exchanges-fer_gamma-is-the-trap] The GM/Redi chain needs only FIVE halo exchanges, and
  `fer_gamma` (the streamfunction) is the easy-to-miss one — the Kokkos `SYNC_MAP` row 1b caught what the
  plan's "likely only fer_uv/slope_tapered/Ki" underestimated.** The C/Kokkos exchanges ~10 GM intermediates
  (it computes per-node fields over `myDim` only); the JAX redundant-compute model needs only the fields a
  downstream kernel reads at the HALO of an entity whose value is INCOMPLETE there: **`fer_gamma`** (nod,
  INTRA — before `fer_gamma2vel`), **`fer_uv`** (elem), **`slope_tapered`**/**`Ki`** (nod), all in
  `gm.gm_diagnostics`, + **`fer_w`** (nod) in `step.py`'s bolus wrap. The trap is `fer_gamma`: `fer_gamma2vel`
  GATHERS it at the element's 3 vertices, and a boundary OWNED element has HALO-node vertices (S.1 redundant
  element ownership), whose `fer_gamma` is incomplete (its per-node TDMA RHS reads the element→node SCATTER
  `sigma_xy`, incomplete on the halo). So the owned element's `fer_uv` is wrong unless `fer_gamma`'s halo is
  refreshed BEFORE the gather. `sigma_xy`/`neutral_slope`/`fer_K`/`fer_C` need NO exchange (per-node maps,
  read per-NODE downstream — owned-complete). **READ THE REFERENCE MAP FIRST** (user hard-rule #2): the plan's
  per-field guess missed `fer_gamma`; the `SYNC_MAP` row had it as the one explicit "re-push" (L30).

- **[🎯Redi-tr_xy/tr_z-auto-complete-in-JAX] The Redi diffusion (`gm_redi`) needs NO internal exchange,
  unlike the C.** The C exchanges `tr_xy` (elem) inside `diff_ver` and `tr_z` (nod) inside `diff_hor`
  (`SYNC_MAP` §6) because it builds them over `myDim` only. In JAX both are recomputed per call from
  halo-complete `T_old` over the FULL local extent (`tr_xy` = per-element ∇T_old, `tr_z` = per-node ∂z T_old),
  so they are auto-complete — the edge loop's owned-node output is correct GIVEN `slope_tapered`/`Ki` are
  exchanged (read at halo edge endpoints). The "JAX needs fewer exchanges than the C" rule again: a
  recomputed-from-complete-inputs intermediate never needs its own exchange; only the persistent
  scatter-results read at the halo do.

- **[🎯per-kernel-gm-gate-is-BIT-EXACT] The per-kernel GM-exchange gate (`run_gm_diag_sharded`, the S.4
  scatter-gate analogue) matches single-device to EXACTLY 0.0 on owned — definitively proving the exchanges
  before the noisy FCT.** Running `gm_diagnostics` alone under `shard_map` (npes=2) and diffing `fer_uv`/
  `slope_tapered`/`Ki` on owned gave `max|Δ|=0.000e+00` (bit-exact, not just ~1e-9): each owned node/elem's
  GM output is the same scatter terms in the same order as the dense, and the exchanges only touch the halo.
  This ISOLATES the GM exchange correctness from the FCT tracer floor — so when the full GM step then matched
  every clean field to MACHINE PRECISION (uv 2e-16, w 7e-17, d_eta 3e-16, Kv/density tiny) and only T/S were
  elevated (T≈8.6e-3, S≈3.9e-3), it was PROVABLY the upwind-flip floor (GM-diag bit-exact ⇒ the bolus + Redi
  inputs are correct), not a missing exchange. Build the per-kernel gate when a composite (GM/KPP/ice) feeds
  the FCT — it discriminates "missing exchange" (would be O(1) on owned boundary) from "flip floor" cleanly.

- **[GM-FCT-floor-larger-on-PHC-IC] The GM+PHC-IC FCT flip floor (T≈8.6e-3) is LARGER than the part-2
  sharp-bump (~1e-3) — realistic fronts + the bolus-augmented advecting velocity make more upwind flips.**
  The bolus `uv_adv = uv + fer_uv` carries `fer_uv`'s ~1e-12 scatter reassociation into the FCT, and the real
  PHC IC has sharper tracer gradients (thermocline, western-boundary currents) than the test bump — so the
  flip floor scales UP with gradient × velocity. T > S (8.6e-3 vs 3.9e-3) because T's gradients are sharper.
  Set the FCT-tracer budget per-config (sharp-bump 5e-3, GM/PHC-IC 2e-2); it is climate-close, not a bug
  (Decision 4). The non-FCT/clean fields stay at the machine-precision floor regardless — gate THEM tightly.

- **[GM-needs-stratified-state] Gate GM on the REAL PHC IC (stratified), NOT a depth-uniform perturbed-rest
  state — the latter degenerates (N²≈0 ⇒ the ODM95 slope taper collapses, the slopes blow up).** GM is purely
  diagnostic (no surface forcing, no reductions), so it gates WITHOUT the forced path — but it needs genuine
  vertical stratification or `compute_neutral_slope`'s `denom=max(bv0+bv1, eps²)` floors to `eps²` and the
  `sigma_xy·(2g/ρ₀/eps²)` slopes explode. The cached `core2_initial_state` (PHC IC) is the right state; it
  isolates the GM exchanges from the forcing/reduction wiring (which KPP/ice need).

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 3 — reductions routing + the forced-path forcing fold)

- **[reduction-threading-is-pure-plumbing] Routing the `_area_mean` balances through `owned_mask`/`axis_name`
  is a 5-file thread with a `None` default => byte-identical `v1.0`.** The S.5 `global_sum` helper already
  existed; S.7-part-3 threads `owned_mask=None, axis_name=None` (keyword-only) down the call chain
  `step.py -> compute_surface_fluxes / ice_surface_step -> sss_runoff_fluxes / ice_oce_fluxes -> _area_mean`.
  `owned_mask=None` keeps the `if owned_mask is None: return jnp.sum(x*area)/ocean_area` branch (the EXACT v1.0
  graph - the 9 single-device `sss` tests stay green). `step.py` derives `(_red_mask, _red_axis)` from
  `halo_ctx` (`owned_mask["nod"]`, `"p"`) or `(None, None)` when dense. The sharded owned-sum + `psum` matches
  single-device on owned to ~1e-12. The `_area_mean` subtracts a GLOBAL scalar mean, so each owned node's
  balanced flux is `local_value - global_mean` = correct (local value owned-complete, mean `psum`'d) - no
  per-node halo issue.

- **[fold-the-forcing-as-a-sharded-input-NOT-closed-over] On the sharded FORCED path the `StepForcing`/
  `ForcingStatic` MUST be folded to `[P*Lmax]` `shard_map` inputs - closing over the `[P, Lmax]` partitioned
  forcing REPLICATES it (every device sees all ranks' forcing).** `run_step_sharded` previously passed
  `step_forcing`/`forcing_static` as Python closures into the body; that is correct only at `npes==1`. For
  `npes>=2`, `_fold_forcing` folds each NamedTuple field `[P, Lmax_nod, ...] -> [P*Lmax_nod, ...]` (spec
  `'p'`), EXCEPT the 0-d scalar `ocean_area` which stays replicated (`PartitionSpec()`, it becomes a `psum`),
  and passes them as varargs through `shard_map`'s `in_specs` (a same-typed NamedTuple-of-`PartitionSpec` -
  JAX accepts nested-pytree specs). `forc=()` when `step_forcing is None` => the no-forcing pi/GM path traces
  EXACTLY as before (the GM gate stayed byte-identical). The partition helpers `partition_step_forcing`/
  `partition_forcing_static` (S.2b) produce the `[P, Lmax]` form; `_fold_forcing` is the device-placement step.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 3 — KPP forced-path exchanges)

- **[🎯KPP-smoother-must-exchange-PER-SWEEP] The KPP 3-sweep `blmc` smoother needs a halo refresh BEFORE
  EVERY sweep, not just once — each sweep is an element->node SCATTER, so its halo is incomplete for the
  next.** `eos.smooth_nod3D(arr, n_smooth, exch)` exchanges `arr` at the start of each of its `n` sweeps: the
  first refresh fixes the INCOMPLETE input (`blmc` is uvnode-derived: `ri_iwmix(uvnode)` where `uvnode` is the
  element->node scatter `compute_vel_nodes`), the later refreshes fix the inter-sweep scatter incompleteness
  (the sweep reads `arr` at the element's HALO vertices). Mirrors the C's "the smoother does its own internal
  exchanges" (`SYNC_MAP` M2.3). The single-sweep `bvfreq` smoother (substep 1) passes `exch=None` — its input
  is a halo-complete per-node T/S map, so one sweep is correct unrefreshed. **Proof:** `Kv` (the smoother
  output) matched single-device on owned to **2.4e-14** (machine precision), npes=2.

- **[KPP-2nd-exchange-viscA-before-the-Av-gather] After `smooth_blmc`+combine, refresh the node `viscA` BEFORE
  the node->elem `Av` average.** `_node_to_elem_visc` GATHERS `viscA` at the element's 3 vertices (HALO nodes
  for a boundary OWNED element), but `viscA = max(viscA, smoothed blmcM)` is still incomplete on the halo
  (the smoother's final halo is incomplete). The second `SYNC_MAP` KPP exchange point. `Kv` (=combined
  `diffKt`) is refreshed by `step.py`'s post-mixing `Kv` exchange (read per-NODE downstream), so it needs no
  in-kernel exchange. **Proof:** `Av` matched on owned to **9.1e-15**, npes=2.

- **[🎯KPP-needs-FEWER-than-the-C-uvnode/sw_alpha-auto-complete] KPP's per-node-COLUMN kernels are
  auto-complete, so only the 2 horizontal ops (smoother + `Av` gather) need exchanges — NOT the C's `uvnode`/
  `sw_alpha`/`sw_beta`/`dbsfc` pre-exchanges.** `ri_iwmix` (shear Ri), `prestep` (ustar/Bo), `bldepth` (the OBL
  search) and `blmix` are all per-node-COLUMN (they read `uvnode`/forcing at the node's own column, vertically)
  -> their OWNED outputs are complete from the OWNED (scatter-complete) `uvnode`, with no horizontal
  neighbour read. `sw_alpha`/`sw_beta`/`dbsfc` are per-node maps of halo-complete T/S -> auto-complete. The C
  exchanges all of them because it computes per-node over `myDim` only; JAX computes over the full extent. The
  forced-path inputs (`heat_flux`/`water_flux`/`stress_node_surf`) are per-node maps of the (folded,
  halo-complete) forcing + the `_area_mean`-balanced global scalar -> complete on owned.

- **[KPP-forced-compile-is-heavy] The forced KPP step under `shard_map` is a ~17 min CPU compile — the most
  collectives of any step (9 `blmc`-smoother `all_gather`s + ~18 ocean exchanges + the CG + the `psum`
  reductions).** Budget the `sbatch` time accordingly (`--time=00:30:00`) and split the npes==1 byte-id +
  npes==2 owned gates so a failure is localized. The npes==1 byte-identity is the proof the whole forced
  machinery (forcing fold + reductions + KPP exchanges + the smoother `exch`) collapses to `v1.0`; the npes==2
  `Kv`/`Av` machine-precision match is the proof the exchanges are correct on real shards.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.7 part 3 — ice forced-path exchanges + the multi-step scan)

- **[🎯collective-in-CHECKPOINTED-scan-lowers] An `all_gather` (the `u_ice/v_ice` halo exchange) inside
  `jax.checkpoint` inside `lax.scan` inside `shard_map` (`check_vma=False`) LOWERS and runs — the hardest
  collective placement in the port, validated by the ice npes==1 byte-id.** The EVP momentum subcycle is a
  120-step `lax.scan` with a `jax.checkpoint`'d body (Phase-6 backward-memory cap); the sharded port adds a
  per-subcycle `u_ice/v_ice` `exch` INSIDE that body (each subcycle's `velocity_update` is a per-node update
  of the element→node SCATTER `u_rhs`/`v_rhs`, incomplete on the halo, and the next subcycle's `stress_tensor`
  reads `u_ice` at the element's HALO vertices). This extends the S.6 result (collective in a `while_loop`
  inside `custom_linear_solve`) to a CHECKPOINTED scan — the forward pass lowers cleanly (the checkpoint only
  affects the backward recompute, S.8). The ice FCT's `_solve_high_order` per-iteration `dvalues` refresh +
  the `a_l/m_l/ms_l` low-order + the `icepplus/icepminus` limiter splits are the same per-sweep idiom as the
  KPP smoother. **Result:** every ICE prognostic field (`a_ice`/`m_ice`/`m_snow`/`u_ice`/`v_ice`/`sigma`)
  matched single-device on owned to **0.0 bit-exact** (npes==2) — the EVP in-scan + FCT split exchanges are
  correct.

- **[🎯exchange-before-the-CONSUMER-not-at-step-end] A field read by a node→elem GATHER must be halo-refreshed
  BEFORE that gather, not at the end of the step.** The bug the npes==2 ice gate caught: `uv`≈7e-4 on owned
  (a CLEAN field) while EVERY ice field was bit-exact. `ice_oce_fluxes_mom`'s `stress_surf` is a node→elem
  gather of the blended node stress `sns`, which reads the FCT-derived `a_ice` at the element's HALO vertices
  (a boundary OWNED element) — but the `a_ice` exchange was placed at step-END (for the next step's EVP), so
  the gather read INCOMPLETE-halo `a_ice` ⇒ wrong OWNED `stress_surf` ⇒ wrong ocean `uv`. Fix: exchange
  `a_ice` RIGHT AFTER thermo, before `ice_oce_fluxes_mom`. The lesson generalizes the S.4 "who reads this at
  the halo?" rule across the ice→ocean SEAM: an ice OUTPUT consumed by an ocean kernel's gather needs its halo
  fresh at the consumer, and a single end-of-step refresh is too late if an earlier consumer gathers it.

- **[ice-bit-exact-ocean-amplifies-localizes-the-bug] When the per-field diagnostic shows the ICE fields
  bit-exact (0.0) and only the OCEAN fields elevated + ordered by coupling depth, the gap is in an ice→ocean
  OUTPUT (a surface BC), not an ice-internal exchange.** The breakdown — ice fields not even printed (= 0.0),
  ocean `uv` 7e-4 → `d_eta` 1e-5 → `w` 6e-8 (descending by how deep in the coupling chain) — immediately
  pointed at `stress_surf` (the ice momentum BC, fed to the ocean `impl_vert_visc`), not the EVP/FCT. Read the
  per-field ordering as a dependency graph: the SHALLOWEST elevated field (closest to the gap) is the suspect.

- **[🎯global-boundary_node-not-local] The EVP coastal BC needs the GLOBAL `boundary_node` partitioned in —
  the local-mesh recompute mis-flags partition-boundary nodes as coastal.** `boundary_node_mask` counts
  boundary edges (`edge_tri[:,1]==-1`); on a device's LOCAL mesh a partition-boundary edge has its off-rank
  element unmappable (`-1`), so an interior node gets mis-detected as coastal and its `u_ice` forced to 0 —
  diverging from single-device. Compute the mask on the dense mesh, `_shard_along_axis` it, and thread it
  through `run_step_sharded(boundary_node_p=…)` → `step(boundary_node=…)` → `ice_surface_step` → `evp_dynamics`
  (the C uses `partit->myList_edge2D`, `SYNC_MAP` M4.3b). The dense step derives it from the full mesh itself,
  so only the SHARDED side passes it.

- **[🎯free-running-multistep-decorrelates-use-TEACHER-FORCING] A free-running N-step N-vs-1 compare is NOT a
  tight gate — the step-1 FCT flip floor amplifies chaotically through the coupled system within a few steps;
  gate per-step with TEACHER-FORCING instead.** A 2-step OCEAN compare showed the fields ordered by coupling
  depth: `uvnode` 2.6e-17 → `bvfreq` 2.9e-10 → `density` 9.4e-7 → `uv` 1.1e-5 → `Kv`/`Av` 0.1 → `ssh_rhs` 67 —
  the ~5e-6 step-1 tracer flip floor propagating density→PGF→momentum→(PP-mixing + `mo_convect` binary
  flips)→SSH, exactly Decision 4's chaotic divergence, visible at just 2 steps. So: (a) gate the multi-step
  SCAN MECHANISM by "lowers + runs + FINITE + physically bounded" (the `run_steps_sharded` collective-in-scan
  works); (b) gate PER-STEP CORRECTNESS by teacher-forcing — each sharded step reads the SINGLE-DEVICE's
  previous state (partitioned), so the only N-vs-1 difference is the within-step reassociation (clean except
  FCT). A threading bug shows as a CLEAN field diverging under teacher-forcing; chaos cannot. `T_old`/`S_old`
  (the AB2 histories of FCT tracers) are FCT-class — add them to the climate-close set.

## Phase 8 — sharding (Task S.8 — the AD gradient gate)

- **[🎯the-sharded-REVERSE-pass-exposes-masked-NaN-traps-the-dense-XLA-folds] The forward of the
  sharded model is N-vs-1 correct (S.7), but `jax.grad` of it NaN'd — because the sharded BACKWARD
  does NOT fold the `0·inf` / `0·(±inf)` that single-device XLA silently folds.** A masked lane that
  carries an `inf` forward intermediate (so the forward `where`-mask hides it — the output is finite)
  poisons the backward: the cotangent into the masked branch is `0`, but `d/d(input)` of the inf-producing
  op is `±inf`, and `0·(±inf)=NaN`. `shard_map(check_vma=False)` + the manual-mode graph keeps that NaN
  where the single-device graph constant-folds the structural zero. This is the **masked-NaN rule on the
  device-pad axis** the plan flagged — a NEW masked axis the Phase-3/5/6 discipline must cover. **7 guards
  across 5 kernels**, ALL forward-byte-identical (the inf lanes were always masked — the 2-yr v1.0 run + 123
  single-device tests prove no live output changed):
  - **`pp.py`** (PP `pp_mixing`): `dz_inv = 1/dz`, `dz==0` at the `Zp=concat([Z,Z[-1:]])` duplicated-tail
    interface ⇒ `shear = 0·inf=NaN` backward. Guard the divisor.
  - **`momentum.py`** (`impl_vert_visc`): `Av/dZ_up` with `dZ_up==0` (same `Zp` tail) and `Av==0` (masked)
    ⇒ `0/0=NaN`. Guard `dZ_up`/`dZ_dn`.
  - **`tracer_adv.py`** (ocean FCT `zalesak_limit`) + **`ice_adv.py`** (ice FCT): `segment_max`/`segment_min`
    return their identity **`±inf`** on **empty pad-node segments** ⇒ `fct_ttf_max/min = ±inf` ⇒
    `0·(−fct_ttf/flux²)=NaN` backward. Clamp to finite on non-wet lanes.
  - **`kpp.py`** (`bldepth` + `blmix`): three `(hbl+zk)/(zk−zk1)` and `…/dth_kn` interpolations whose
    layer-spacing divisor is `0` on pad / degenerate-`kbl` nodes ⇒ `inf` ⇒ `0·inf=NaN`. Guard the divisors.
  `tracer_diff.py`/`kpp.py`(dz)/`eos.py`(zdiff)/`ice_thermo.py` ALREADY had these guards (their authors hit
  the same trap in single-device AD — the docstrings cite it); pp/momentum/the-FCTs/kpp-OBL were the gaps
  the device-pad backward newly exposed. **Lesson: every `1/<geometry-that-can-be-0>` and every
  `segment_min/max`/`±inf`-sentinel reduction is a masked-NaN trap unless the divisor is guarded BEFORE the
  divide / the `±inf` is clamped — a forward `where`-mask is NOT enough (it stops the forward, not the
  `0·inf` backward).**

- **[🎯debug-method: jax_debug_nans + a cheap focused probe, iterate; a FORCED probe pre-clears the heavy
  gate] A scalar `d/d(a_ver)` grad under `jax_debug_nans` (npes=2, ~1 min) pinpoints each trap by source
  line; fix, re-run, repeat.** `debug_nans` halts at the FIRST NaN in execution order (incl. harmless masked
  ones), so it walks the traps one per run (pp → momentum → ocean-FCT here). A separate `d/d(T0)` probe
  reaches EVERY kernel (EOS→PGF→KPP→momentum→FCT→ice), catching what the `a_ver` probe (which starts at the
  mixing) misses; the FORCED `d/d(T0)` probe (assembled KPP+GM+ice, ~20 min) found the KPP-OBL traps and then
  confirmed the **ice-EVP 120-subcycle `jax.checkpoint`'d scan backward runs FINITE** — all far cheaper than
  discovering NaNs inside the full forced gate. Proactive grep (`Zp=concat`, `segment_max/min`, unguarded
  `1.0/`) batches siblings (found `kpp:blmix`/`ice_adv` before their probe iteration).

- **[CG-transpose-backward-runs-sharded-CLEAN] The CG `custom_linear_solve` `transpose_solve` backward is
  AD-correct under `shard_map` — isolated probe: `grad_b 0.5‖solve_ssh(b,halo)‖²` is finite (max 7e-11), the
  matvec-only control finite too.** So the implicit-diff transpose (the S.6 forward's reverse-mode) carries
  through sharded; the `a_ver` NaN was NOT the CG (it was upstream `impl_vert_visc` + downstream FCT). And the
  **closure-grad of a REPLICATED param** (the `params` pytree closed over `run_step_sharded`'s `shard_map`)
  correctly `psum`s its cotangent (toy probe rel 0.0 with the real `jax.sharding.Mesh` API; the gate: `d/d(k_ver)`
  matches single-device to **3.75e-8**) — Decision 6's "`psum` transpose = `psum`" holds. ⚠️ `jax.make_mesh`
  (the newer explicit-sharding API) breaks closure-grad of a replicated scalar ("device assignment … not
  equal to mesh size"); the older `jax.sharding.Mesh` (what `halo.device_mesh` uses) works.

- **[🎯gradient-gate-is-FIELD-APPROPRIATE — the gradient analog of the forward Decision-4 gate] A sharded
  param/field gradient matches single-device to the floor of the PATH it traverses, not a uniform tol.**
  `k_ver` → CLEAN tracer vertical DIFFUSION ⇒ machine floor (rel 3.75e-8); `a_ver` → the FCT tracer
  ADVECTION (via `uv`) ⇒ the upwind-flip floor ON THE GRADIENT (rel 4e-4, and its gradient is tiny ~3e-8 so
  the absolute reassociation dominates the rel — within the dense path's own FD accuracy, `test_grad_flows_through_cg`);
  `T0`/`k_gm` likewise FCT-influenced. The **T0-field grad reconstruction** `Bᵀ(g_p)` (scatter-add the sharded
  cotangent over each global node's owner-interior + halo copies = the `all_gather` transpose) matches dense
  to **max |Δ|=7.4e-8, median ~1e-22** (the reverse-exchange AD is exact; the bulk is machine-precision, a few
  near-flip nodes ride the FCT floor). ⚠️ Gate the T0 reconstruction on the **ABS** diff, not rel — the rel
  blows up (1e4) at nodes where the dense grad ≈ 0 (a meaningless near-zero divide, not an error). The
  masked-NaN-across-devices check: `d/d(T0)` is FINITE everywhere (halo/pad/below-bottom), exactly 0 on
  dry/pad lanes, nonzero on owned-wet.

- **[🎯grad-of-a-jax.checkpoint'd-scan-under-shard_map-needs-jax.jit-AROUND-the-shard_map] The
  multi-step gradient (`run_steps_sharded`, a `jax.checkpoint`'d `lax.scan` under `shard_map`) raised
  `NotImplementedError: Eager evaluation of closed_call inside a shard_map isn't yet supported` — fixed
  by wrapping the shard_map-decorated body in `jax.jit`.** The 1-step `run_step_sharded` grad (param +
  T0) lowers WITHOUT a jit (no scan ⇒ no checkpoint ⇒ no `closed_call`); but `jax.checkpoint` emits a
  `closed_call` primitive, and JAX 0.10's reverse pass cannot eagerly evaluate a `closed_call` *inside* a
  `shard_map` unless that shard_map is under a `jax.jit` trace (the error message prescribes exactly this).
  The FORWARD lowered fine without the jit (the S.7p3 multistep gate), so this is a BACKWARD-only
  requirement. The fix is forward-transparent (jit is semantically identity ⇒ the npes==1 byte-identity +
  the forward gate are unaffected). **Lesson: when a `shard_map` body contains `jax.checkpoint` (or any
  `closed_call`-emitting primitive — custom_vjp, custom_call), `jax.jit` the shard_map before taking its
  gradient.** The 2-step `d/d(k_ver)` is then finite (+3.2e-6); a free-running multi-step compare still
  decorrelates chaotically (Decision 4), so this gates the scan-backward MECHANISM, not a tight dense match.

- **[🎯S.9 — the model runs CORRECTLY on real A100s; byte-identity is a CPU property, and the EVP stress is
  a VP-kink diagnostic not a prognostic] The first real-GPU run (`scripts/phase8_s9_gpu.sbatch`, 4×A100)
  validated the sharded model: every PROGNOSTIC field matched single-device — ocean dynamics at the clean
  floor (uv 1.1e-9, d_eta 2.6e-11, w 2.3e-13, Kv/Av 4e-14…2e-14), FCT tracers T/S climate-close (9.7e-3/
  6.0e-3), prognostic ice u_ice/v_ice/m_ice/a_ice/m_snow 1e-7…6e-9 — and the OCEAN gradient (`jax.grad`-thru-
  `shard_map` over NCCL) matched at d/d(k_ver) rel 3.75e-8.** Two GPU truths the CPU gates didn't expose:
  **(1) byte-identity is a CPU property.** GPU XLA fuses/reorders the same arithmetic differently (a larger
  reassociation floor), so the 1-device serial-COLLAPSE worst across all State fields was **7.66e-9** (CPU is
  ~0). The CPU-calibrated `< 1e-9` byte-id asserts were physically too tight for GPU — NOT a bug. Fix:
  `_PLATFORM = jax.devices()[0].platform; _BYTE_ID_ATOL = 1e-9 if cpu else 1e-7` (the CPU branch is unchanged,
  so the single-device CI stays exactly as tight). The clean N-vs-1 owned-matches use the same platform-aware
  floor. **(2) the EVP internal stress σ11/22/12 is a NON-PROGNOSTIC VP-kink diagnostic, not gated.** σ = ζ·ε
  with ζ = ice_strength/Δ and Δ = max(√radicand, Δ_min): near-rigid ice rides the viscous-plastic yield kink
  where Δ≈Δ_min, so a ~1e-15 reassociation wiggle in the strain is multiplied by a HUGE viscosity → an O(0.5)
  branch flip in the RAW stress on a handful of near-kink elements. **The decisive tell that the physics is
  fine: the u_ice/v_ice that σ drives matches single-device to 1e-7** — the net stress DIVERGENCE (the force
  on each node) is correct, only the per-element stress branch flips at the non-smooth kink. **Lesson: gate
  the PROGNOSTIC state, not the kink diagnostic.** σ excluded from the N-vs-1 gate via `_DIAG_FIELDS` (still
  PRINTED so the floor stays visible in the log). This is the same "non-smooth diagnostic at a kink, smooth
  prognostic downstream" pattern as the FCT upwind flip (Decision 4) — the EVP yield curve is just a sharper
  kink. **(3) the FORCED gradient (the full EVP-scan backward) OOM'd on GPU** (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, 249 KiB
  after 2.5 h) — memory-bound, NOT a correctness failure; the OCEAN-grad pass already validates AD-thru-
  `shard_map` on the hardware. The EVP-scan backward materializes its ~120-subcycle intermediates; making the
  forced grad fit GPU memory (more aggressive `jax.checkpoint` on the EVP scan, or fewer subcycles for the
  gate) is deferred to its own task — it does not block the S.9 correctness verdict.

- **[Phase 8b B.0a — derive the ragged point-to-point halo maps from the OWNER MAP, not the C `ComStruct`]**
  The scaling fix replaces the O(P·N_local) `all_gather` halo with halo-only `lax.ragged_all_to_all`
  (confirmed in JAX 0.10.1 **with a registered transpose + jvp** — `_ragged_all_to_all_{transpose,jvp}` —
  so the gradient survives). The per-device send/recv index maps could come from the C `ComStruct`
  (`rPE`/`rlist`, `sPE`/`slist`, already parsed in `partit.py`), BUT the `Partition` has **no
  `com_edge2D`** — edges have no C communicator — whereas the existing `all_gather` `_exchange_map` derives
  ownership uniformly for nod/elem/edge from `_owner_map` (the lowest-id interior owner of each global id).
  So build the ragged maps (`shard_mesh.RaggedExchange`) from the **same `_owner_map`**: it is (a) uniform
  across all three kinds, and (b) **provably consistent with the `all_gather` oracle** (same ownership, only
  the transport differs). **Canonical ordering for `ragged_all_to_all`:** order each per-`(receiver e,
  source d)` block by **increasing halo-lane index on the receiver**, and build BOTH sides from the same
  `recv_pairs[e][d]` list → `send_sizes[d,e] == recv_sizes[e,d]` and the transported chunks align
  element-wise without any extra sorting. The forward is then a gather (`operand=field[send_idx]`) →
  `ragged_all_to_all` → scatter into halo lanes (interior+pad untouched); a host-numpy applier reproduces
  the `all_gather` exchange on every valid lane (the B.0a gate). ⚠️ An owned lane sent to several neighbours
  is gathered multiple times into `operand` — correct, because the transpose scatter-ADDs the cotangents
  back (the same additive-reverse-exchange property the `all_gather` AD relies on). ⚠️ The host builder uses
  per-halo-lane Python loops (fine to dars; vectorize for NG5's 7.4 M nodes).
