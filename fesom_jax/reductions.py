"""Distributed reductions for the FESOM2 → JAX port (Phase 8, Task S.5).

The JAX rendering of the C's ``integrate_nod_2D`` + ``MPI_Allreduce(SUM)``: sum over
a device's **owned, unpadded** entities (mask halo + pad → 0 to avoid double-count),
then ``jax.lax.psum`` over the device axis (mirrors
``Kokkos parallel_reduce(0, myDim)`` + ``MPI_Allreduce``).

All the per-step reductions are **node**-based (``_area_mean`` for the
virtual-salt / relax-salt / water-flux balances; the CG dot-products over nodes;
``ocean_area``). Nodes are uniquely partitioned (``owned_mask`` IS the unique-owner
mask), so an owned-node sum + ``psum`` is exact — the element/edge redundant-ownership
caveat (S.1) does NOT apply here (there are no per-step element/edge reductions).

``axis_name=None`` ⇒ the single-device path: a plain masked sum, and with an
all-True ``owned_mask`` it is the *exact* ``jnp.sum`` the dense kernels use (so the
``npes==1`` reductions stay byte-identical to ``v1.0``).
